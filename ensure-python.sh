# Ensure a Python >= 3.10 interpreter is available for the backend venv.
# Called by: Makefile (backend), setup.sh
# Platforms: macOS, Amazon Linux 2 (system python3 is 3.7), Amazon Linux 2023
#            (system python3 is 3.9), Linux
#
# The package requires Python >= 3.10 (pyproject `requires-python`; the code
# uses stdlib features such as contextlib.aclosing that need 3.10). Amazon
# Linux 2 ships Python 3.7 and Amazon Linux 2023 ships 3.9 as `python3`, so
# `python3 -m venv` produces a too-old venv and either `pip install -e .` fails
# to resolve modern deps (AL2/3.7) or the install "succeeds" and then crashes at
# import (AL2023/3.9). Prefer any already-usable system Python >= 3.10;
# otherwise install one via mise, whose python-build-standalone binaries run on
# AL2's glibc 2.26. On success the chosen interpreter's real path — symlinks
# resolved, see _resolve — is recorded in "<data-home>/python-bin" so
# non-interactive callers (make) can use it without re-running a version
# manager. The data home is "$KIROCREW_HOME" when set, else
# "$HOME/.kiro/crew" (the current default) — NOT the pre-move "$HOME/.kirocrew",
# which the one-time data-home migration deletes, so writing there would
# resurrect the legacy dir on every build.

# Resolve a python path through any symlinks. Every candidate is passed through
# this before being reported or recorded, because the recorded path is what
# `make backend` runs `-m venv` with, and python-build-standalone interpreters —
# what uv, mise and pyenv install — locate their stdlib relative to the
# *invoked* path's dirname instead of following the symlink first. Creating a
# venv from a symlink such as "$HOME/.local/bin/python3.13" (how uv and mise
# expose an interpreter on PATH) therefore writes `home = $HOME/.local/bin` into
# pyvenv.cfg, so the venv looks for the stdlib under
# "$HOME/.local/lib/python3.13" and aborts with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module
# named 'encodings'", failing ensurepip and the build. That is fatal wherever
# venv copies the interpreter instead of symlinking it, which is the default for
# framework builds on macOS. Resolve with Python rather than realpath(1) or
# `readlink -f`, whose presence and flags differ across the macOS and Amazon
# Linux targets above; the interpreter is already known to run by this point.
