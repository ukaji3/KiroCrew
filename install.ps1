#  KiroCrew — Windows setup (cloud mode)
# ======================================================================
#  This is the CLOUD path: Kiro Crew runs on an EC2 Linux instance in YOUR OWN
#  AWS account and this machine is the thin client. Use it when you want the
#  gateway always-on and off your laptop.
#
#  It is NOT the only Windows option. Kiro Crew also builds and runs natively
#  on Windows from source (`.\make.ps1 build`, then `kirocrew gateway`) — see
#  docs/guides/windows-install.md, which is the supported default and covers
#  the per-feature limits.
#
#  This script only ensures the client prerequisites — Python, the AWS CLI,
#  and the SSM Session Manager plugin — then hands off to the Python launcher
#  wizard (`kirocrew cloud launch`).
#
#  It NEVER stores AWS credentials: the aws CLI resolves them from your
#  configured profile/SSO.
#
#  Usage (from a clone):   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
#  Options:
#     -NonInteractive   Do not launch the wizard; just install prerequisites.
#     -Size <tier>      Pass a size tier straight through (light|balanced|power).
