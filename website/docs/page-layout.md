# Page Layout Guide

Every dashboard page follows one layout pattern. Copy the skeleton below rather
than inventing a custom layout: a page that diverges costs a reader the
orientation cues (title block position, scroll container, section rhythm) that
every other page gives them for free.

Components come from [`src/components/ui.tsx`](../src/components/ui.tsx); the
conventions around them (a11y, data fetching, typography) live in
[frontend-conventions](frontend-conventions.md).

## Page skeleton

```tsx
<>
  <PageHeader title="PageName" subtitle="Short description" />
  <div className="px-6 pb-8 overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0">
    {/* optional StatCard row, then Cards with tables/forms */}
  </div>
</>
```

`PageHeader` owns its own `px-6 pt-2 pb-3`, so the content container supplies the
horizontal padding for everything below it. `overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0` is
what makes the content the scrolling region while the header stays put: the shell
is height-locked, so without `min-h-0` the flex child refuses to shrink and the
whole page scrolls instead.

`PageHeader` also takes an `actions` node, rendered right-aligned on the title
row. Put page-level buttons there rather than in the first `Card`.

## Stat cards

OPTIONAL summary metrics above the content. Add a row only when a number is not
already visible in the content below it: a rolled-up total, a rate, an error
count. Do NOT add one that restates `items.length` for a list rendered on the
same screen; it costs roughly 90px above the fold and carries no action. A page
with no stat card row is conformant.

```tsx
<div className="grid gap-3.5 grid-cols-[repeat(auto-fit,minmax(150px,1fr))] mb-6">
  <StatCard label="Total" value={count} accent />
  <StatCard label="Active" value={active} />
</div>
```

`StatCard` renders a pulsing skeleton when `value` is `undefined` or `null`, so
pass the query result straight through instead of branching on a loading flag.
Pass `delay` (in ms) to join the grid's stagger. Give it `onClick` only when the
card is really actionable; it then wires `role="button"`, `tabIndex` and
Enter/Space itself.

## Data sections

`Card` + `CardTitle` + `InfoTip`:

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardTitle>Section Name <InfoTip text="Explanation." /></CardTitle>
  <SearchInput placeholder="Filter…" value={filter} onChange={…} />
  {items.length === 0
    ? <EmptyState icon={<Anchor className="lucide-inline" />} title="None yet" />
    : <table className="w-full border-collapse table-striped">…</table>}
</Card>
```

Inside a **side panel**, a counted list-section header is `PanelSectionHeader`
(label + count node + hairline rule), never a hand-rolled one. Hierarchy comes
from weight and size, never from an opacity modifier, and the label is not
uppercased (`text-transform` is a no-op on CJK).

## Tables

Striped body, one header cell style:

```tsx
<th className="text-left text-muted text-[12px] uppercase tracking-[.04em] px-2.5 py-2 border-b border-border font-medium">
```

`table-striped` shades even rows with `var(--card-hl)`.

## Forms

Inline within a `Card`, built from the shared primitives:

- `Input` for text fields.
- `SendBtn` for the primary action (accent-colored).
- `Btn` for secondary actions, `Btn danger` for destructive ones.
- `Checkbox` from `ui.tsx` for a boolean box.
- **Dropdowns: never a native `<select>`.** Its popup is drawn by the OS, so it
  ignores every theme token, cannot be styled per row, and looks nothing like
  the rest of the app. Pick by list length and purpose:
  - `SettingsSelect` (`components/settings.tsx`) on a Settings page — label +
    description + dropdown as one field. The choke point for that surface.
  - `SimpleSelect` (`components/SimpleSelect.tsx`) anywhere else, up to roughly
    fifteen options. Radix Select under the hood; takes `options` /
    `optionLabels` / `value` / `onChange(value)`, and `action` for a trailing
    "+ New…" row.
  - `SearchableSelect` (`components/SearchableSelect.tsx`) past that, or any
    list a user would want to filter (timezones, file lists). Radix Popover plus
    a filter box.
  - `DropdownMenu` (`components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`) for a menu of *commands*
    rather than a bound value.
  - `AgentSelector` for agent dropdowns specifically (portal-based, ARIA-wired).

  These render a `<button>`, not a `<select>`, so an external
  `<label htmlFor>` does **not** name them — pass `aria-label`.
- `Toggle` for a boolean switch. It carries `role="switch"`, `aria-checked` and
  `aria-disabled` itself, so do not re-add them.

## Status indicators

- `Badge variant="ok" | "err" | "warn" | "aim" | "muted"`.
- `SourceBadge source="…"` for provenance (where an agent, app, or skill came
  from). It maps known sources to colors and falls back to a neutral pill for an
  unknown one, so pass the raw source string.

## Errors

A dismissible banner above the content:

```tsx
<div className="mb-4 bg-danger/10 border border-danger/20 rounded-lg p-3 flex items-start gap-3 animate-rise">
```

## Animations

`animate-rise` on cards and banners, `animate-scale-in` on inline reveals. Both
are Tailwind utilities defined in `tailwind.config.js`, and both use
`backwards` fill so an `animationDelay` holds the element hidden until its turn.

## Do NOT

- Wrap a page in `<div className="p-6 max-w-[960px] mx-auto">`. Use
  `PageHeader` + the `px-6 pb-8` container.
- Use a raw `<input>` / `<button>`. Use `Input`, `Btn`, `SendBtn`,
  `SearchInput`, `Checkbox`.
- Use a native `<select>`. There is no styled wrapper for one any more — see
  §Forms for which dropdown component to reach for. Enforced by
  `no-restricted-syntax` in `eslint.config.js`.
- Use raw status text. Use `Badge` or `SourceBadge`.
- Use `text-xs`. Use `text-[13px]`.
- Add a new CSS `@keyframes`. Use Framer Motion, or an existing utility.
