# Page Layout Guide

Every dashboard page follows one layout pattern. Copy the skeleton below rather
than inventing a custom layout: a page that diverges costs a reader the
orientation cues (title block position, scroll container, section rhythm) that
every other page gives them for free.

Components come from [`src/components/ui.tsx`](../src/components/ui.tsx); the
conventions around them (a11y, data fetching, typography) live in
[frontend-conventions](frontend-conventions.md).

## Page skeleton

```tsx
<>
  <PageHeader title="PageName" subtitle="Short description" />
  <div className="px-2 md:px-6 pb-8 overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0">
    {/* optional StatCard row, then Cards with tables/forms */}
  </div>
</>
```

`PageHeader` owns its own `px-2 md:px-6 pt-2 pb-3` — the SAME horizontal gutter as the
content container below it, so the title shares a left edge with the cards and rows it
labels. Keep them equal: a header that drifts off the container's gutter insets the
title from its own content, and the top bar above is a separate layer that does not
have to match (see "The title belongs to the content column" below).
`overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0` is what makes the content the scrolling region while
the header stays put: the shell is height-locked, so without `min-h-0` the flex child
refuses to shrink and the whole page scrolls instead.

`PageHeader` also takes an `actions` node, rendered right-aligned on the title
row. Put page-level buttons there rather than in the first `Card`.

### Read every class here narrow-first

**The unprefixed value is the PHONE's. `md:` adds the desktop.** `px-2 md:px-6` is a
gutter that starts at 8px and widens; `p-5 max-md:px-2.5` is the same intent written
backwards. Both render identically, and only the first one is maintainable.

This is not a style preference. Tailwind is built narrow-first, so a rule whose
unprefixed value is the desktop one forces every narrow fix to claw the width back
with `max-md:` and, usually, a negative margin hand-pinned to a number owned in
another file. That pairing is invisible when it breaks: the pane slides past the
screen edge, and on a script that breaks between characters nothing overflows, so no
scroll assertion sees it. Writing the phone value unprefixed removes the second
number instead of documenting how to keep it in sync.

So the sections below are not exceptions to a desktop standard. They are the
baseline, and the desktop is what `md:` adds to it.

### The narrow-viewport inset budget

These are **recommendations for the narrow branch only** — nothing here changes a
page from `md` up, and `AUTOSDE.yaml` does not enforce a gutter value. A page that
keeps one gutter at every width is conformant.

**Recommended below `md`: an 8px page gutter (`px-2`) and a 10px `Card` horizontal
inset (`px-2.5 … md:px-5`)**, serving a budget of **no more than ~19px of stacked inset
before body text** (8 + a 1px border + 10). 10px is the value the Skills and Steering cards have run since the
card-flush work, so this makes the default match what was already reviewed on a phone
rather than introducing a third number.

Padding stacks, and the eye reads the SUM. The gutter is 24px from `md` up, where
it is comfortable. At 390px the same 24px plus a 20px card inset put card text
44px from the screen — 88px of a 390px screen, **22.6%**, spent on nothing, and
the line that pays is the longest content in the card.

Which layer yields is not arbitrary:

- **Both layers yield, the one against a DRAWN border yields less.** `Card` goes to
  10px horizontally — narrowed, never flushed. Its inset is often the only gutter its
  own rows have, so flushing a card to 0 is still wrong (see below). The VERTICAL
  inset stays 20px: horizontal is the axis a phone cannot spare, and changing the
  vertical would move every card's height.
- **The layer against the SCREEN EDGE yields more.** A phone bezel is not a drawn
  line, so 8px reads as intentional rather than cramped.

This deviates from the 16px screen margin that Material, Apple HIG, Fluent, Carbon,
Polaris, Primer and Atlassian all converge on — deliberately, and in the direction
those systems actually intend. Their 16px is content-to-edge for content that is
**not already inside a bordered container**: a Material list item at a 16px margin
puts its text at 16px, not at 36px. Matching the *effective text inset* is truer to
that convergence than matching the gutter number and then stacking another inset on
top of it. For reference, agent text in the chat transcript starts at 20px -- measured
against the built stylesheet, not inferred -- and the Skills/Steering cards already run
this 10px inset, so 19px matches this app's densest reviewed reading
surface rather than going below it.

Measured on a plain `Card` page (Notifications). At 390px the card goes from 342px
to 374px wide and its text line from 300px to 352px, **+17.3%**; at 320px the card
goes from 272px to 304px and the text line from 230px to 282px, **+22.6%**. Nothing
changes from `md` up. The text-line figures subtract the card's 1px borders as well
as its padding, because a border is opaque to text the same way padding is.

The one exception is `OnboardingChapterShell`, a full-page surface with its own
`sm:px-10` scale rather than a `PageHeader` + container page.

### The title belongs to the content column, not to the chrome

Going down the left of a phone screen there are two layers, and they are allowed to
differ:

| | narrow | made of |
|---|---|---|
| **content column** — `PageHeader`, page rows, `Card` boxes | **8px** | the page gutter, `px-2` |
| `Card` body text | 19px | 8 + 1px border + the `Card`'s own 10 |
| top bar glyphs (chrome) | 20px | header `pl-3` (12) + each icon button's own 8 |

The title shares the container's 8px so it sits directly above the left edge of the
cards and rows it labels. This was tried the other way first — the header moved to
20px to meet the top bar — and it read worse: the title then sat 12px *inside* the
very cards beneath it, which is the misalignment a reader actually notices, because
the title and the content are one column and the chrome is not part of it.

What DID need fixing was the top bar. Its glyphs sit at 20px by construction (12px
header inset plus each icon button's own 8px), but a redundant mobile-only `px-2` on
the left cluster stacked on top of that and pushed the hamburger glyph out to **28px**
— far enough from the content column to read as misaligned on every page. Removing
that one class lands it at 20px. Only the LEFT cluster: `.tb-right` carries a
padding/negative-margin pair that keeps the notification badge's 4px overhang from
being clipped, and re-tuning it needs a real WebKit check rather than a local one.

For scale, agent text in the chat transcript starts at 20px — the message row is
`px-5` with no responsive variant, measured against the built stylesheet. Chat is
where a phone user spends most of their time, so a page's own content column being
tighter than that is deliberate: a page is a denser surface than a transcript, and the
`Card` inset carries its text to 19px anyway.

`src/test/narrowFirstBaseline.test.ts` pins the header to the container gutter the
skeleton above documents, and separately pins the top bar's left cluster against the
redundant inset coming back.

### If you write a shared primitive, a breakpoint-scoped base padding is a trap

This one is for primitive authors rather than page authors, and it cost this repo a
silent desktop regression before it was written down.

`twMerge` only collapses classes that collide at the **same** breakpoint. So the
moment a primitive spells its base inset with a prefix — `md:px-5` — a caller's
plain `p-3` no longer displaces it. The two sit side by side, the caller gets its
12px on a phone, and from `md` up the primitive's 20px quietly wins. The call site
reads as 12px everywhere and is not.

Making every caller spell both halves (`p-3 md:p-3`) does close it, but it is the
wrong shape twice over: it is a permanent obligation on every future caller, and any
guard for it has to be lexical, so a computed `className={cond ? 'p-3' : ''}` or a
class list held in a module const walks straight past.

What `Card` does instead: if the incoming `className` names a padding on an axis,
the base inset for THAT axis is dropped rather than merged, decided from the final
string at render time. The caller owns the axis it asked for, at every width, and no
call site has to know the trap exists. `src/test/cardInsetYield.test.tsx` pins it by
rendering, including the computed-`className` case.

Any new primitive that pairs a `md:`-prefixed base padding with `twMerge` re-opens
the same hole, so either yield the axis the same way or keep the base unprefixed.
Stated honestly: `Card` is currently the ONLY primitive in `ui.tsx` with a
breakpoint-scoped base padding — `Btn`, `Input`, `StatCard` and `Chip` are all
unprefixed — so this note has no other instance to fix today. It is here because the
failure is silent and desktop-only, which is exactly the kind a reader will not
re-derive when they reach for `md:px-*` in a new primitive.

### Other narrow-viewport recommendations

Also recommendations, not gates. Each earned its place by breaking on a real screen,
and each carries the measurement that settled it — reach for the measurement before
arguing with the rule.

**A collapsed side rail becomes a horizontal bar across the TOP, never a thin vertical
strip.** Horizontal is the one axis a phone cannot spare; vertical it can. A 44px strip
overflows nothing, so it looks fixed while the reading column still pays for it.

**Hiding is not collapsing.** A control removed below `md` needs an entry point at that
width — an overflow menu, a drawer, a disclosure. A pane that hides the only host of the
phase-advance controls leaves the phone user unable to advance the phase at all.

**Gate on the constraint, not the viewport.** When a pane can be narrow at any viewport
(a split, a resizable rail, an embedded panel), measure the PANE with a `ResizeObserver`
rather than calling `useIsMobile()`. A 1280px window can hold a 200px pane.

**A tabbed shell's pane needs its own top inset once the header goes away — and it
must be the only one.** `SidePanelLayout` drops the desktop header block below `md` —
the block whose `pb-3` put 12px between a tab's title and its content — and replaces it
with a pill strip that ends in a drawn `border-b`. The pane kept no inset of its own, so
a tab whose first element is a `Card` or a `StatCard` rendered that element's own border
ON the divider: two lines touching, measured at a 0px gap on four of Agent Capabilities'
seven tabs and on seven of Developer's eight renderable ones at 390px. The pane carries
`pt-3` on the narrow branch only — desktop must stay at 0 or the two insets stack.

That inset is shared by all three pages built on the shell (Agent Capabilities,
Developer, Settings), which makes the second half of the rule as load-bearing as the
first: **a tab must not add a top margin to its own first element.** Doing so stacks on
the pane and lands that tab 28px down while its siblings sit at 12px — the inconsistency
reads as sloppiness precisely because the tabs are one keystroke apart. Two shapes, and
the difference is whether the heading can ever have a sibling above it:

- **A heading at the tab's root** (`SkillsTab`, `SteeringTab`) drops the margin outright.
  Do NOT reach for `first:mt-0` here: `SkillsTab` renders `PendingSkillsPanel` above the
  heading, and that panel returns `null` when nothing is pending — so the heading moves in
  and out of `:first-child` with the pending count, and a positional rule would make the
  gap depend on it. (A conditionally rendered `Modal` does NOT have this effect: it
  `createPortal`s to `document.body` and never occupies a sibling slot.)
- **A heading that repeats within one tab** (`SettingsSection`, used many times per
  Settings tab; `LocalStorageDebug`'s section headings) keeps `mt-4`, because the gap
  between two sections is real, and pairs it with `first:mt-0`. The fragment adds no DOM
  node, so every section header is a sibling in one parent and only the leading one
  matches — and when a tab renders something of its own above the first section, the
  header stops being first and correctly keeps the margin.

Measured at 390px with `website/scripts/capture-side-panel-pane-inset.mjs`, which reports
the divider→first-in-flow-box distance per tab: all 31 renderable tabs across the three
pages now read 12px. Residual differences in where the first *pixel* lands (21px on
Connections, on Developer > System, on Settings > Instances) are a control's own internal
padding — a sub-tab's or a segmented button's tap target — not stacked page padding, and
tightening those would shrink a touch target.

**An unbounded action cluster leaves the text row; it does not shrink it.** A row of
actions whose count depends on state (enabled, updatable, uninstallable) and that carries
`shrink-0` takes its natural width, and the text column gets the remainder — measured at
34px on a 390px screen, and 0px at 320px. Move the cluster to its own row below the text.

**A per-character-breaking script collapses instead of overflowing, so overflow metrics
cannot see it.** CJK text reaches `scrollWidth == clientWidth` while wrapping to one or
two characters per line. Judge a reading column by its WIDTH, not by whether anything
overflowed.

**Two coupled numbers must be pinned by a test.** A negative margin that cancels an inset
(`-mx-2.5 md:mx-0` against `Card`'s own `px-2.5`), or a pull-back sized to a tile's width plus a
gap, is ONE number written twice. Changing one alone misaligns silently — nothing
overflows, so only a test that asserts the pair catches it.

**An icon alone cannot carry a state-changing action.** `aria-label` fixes the screen
reader, not the sighted user, who is left guessing what a bare glyph does. Icon-only is
for neutral, recoverable affordances (refresh, expand), not for a write.

**Verify at 320px, not only 390px.** 320 is the floor every major design system bottoms
out at, and it is where a layout that merely looks tight at 390 actually breaks — the
Apps card measured a 34px text column at 390px and 0px at 320px.

**Build touch targets to 44px; grade them in two tiers.** 44px is the number every system
recommends. WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8's floor is 24x24, but it carries a **spacing** exception: an
undersized target still conforms if a 24px circle centred on it does not intersect a
neighbour's. So under 24x24 *and* crowded is a conformance failure; under 44x44 alone is a
convention miss. Reporting every sub-44 control as a violation over-reports by roughly 3x.

**`overflow: hidden` on ANY ancestor kills `position: sticky` — use `overflow: clip`.**
Same family: a `transform` on an ancestor re-anchors `position: fixed` children, and
`align-self: start` is the most common silent sticky failure in flex and grid. A sticky
element also cannot escape its own parent's box, so a bar that must outlive a scrolling
sibling has to be that sibling's SIBLING, not its child.

**`100vh` resolves against the LARGE viewport.** A `100vh` panel overflows while the URL
bar is showing and its bottom controls fall off screen. Use `svh` for app shells, since it
does not reflow as the bar animates, and `dvh` only for surfaces that must track the exact
visible area (a chat container, a modal). Safe area is **padding, not size**:
`padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`, which resolves to 0 without
`viewport-fit=cover`.

**Use the line-length cap in reverse to tell "ugly" from "broken".** WCAG 1.4.8 caps a
reading measure at 80 characters, 40 for CJK. Run it backwards and a squeezed pane stops
being a matter of taste: a 50px column at 13px holds three CJK glyphs, which is a defect
you can state as a number.

**Reach for a `Card` less often on a phone.** A card buys grouping with a drawn border
plus its own inset — on a 390px screen that is 20px of width and a line the screen edge
already implies. Where a section is the only thing on the page, or where the grouping is
already obvious from a heading, prefer a heading plus content and let the page gutter do
the work. Cards earn their keep when several peer groups must be told apart on one
screen; they cost the most when they are nested, since each level charges its inset
again.

**An overflowing action row belongs in an overflow menu — not wrapped, not silently
scrolled.** This is the one place the design systems are unanimous (Primer's `ActionBar`,
Carbon's five-action cap, Apple's "define which items move to the overflow menu"), and it
is what `AUTOSDE.yaml`'s `max-two-buttons-per-row` encodes. Wrapping such a row below `md`
keeps the controls reachable, but it is an interim, not the answer.

### Horizontal insets below the breakpoint

Padding stacks, and the eye reads the SUM. On a wide viewport a page gutter plus a card
inset plus a row inset is comfortable; at 390px it is not. The skill-budget row measured
16px (page) + 20px (`Card`) + 16px (row) = **52px** before its text, against 20px for the
same text in chat.

The page container keeps the `px-2 md:px-6 pb-8` the skeleton above prescribes -- that is what
`AUTOSDE.yaml`'s `page-layout-pattern` requires, and it is not the layer to change. The
third layer is the one to drop:

**Below `md`, prefer no horizontal padding on a row that is a DIRECT child of a `Card`.**
The page gutter and the card's own inset already supply it:

```tsx
<div className="… py-2 md:px-4">   {/* row: the card supplies the inset while narrow */}
```

Gate **every** row in that card the same way -- section header, group header, data row,
footnote. Gating only some of them leaves the data rows sitting to the left of the headers
that label them, which reads as rows escaping their own section.

**The direct-child part is the precondition, not a detail.** The rule works because the
card is what supplies the inset the row gives up. Put an unpadded bordered pane between
them and that stops being true:

```tsx
<Card>                                                   {/* 20px */}
  <div className="… border border-border rounded-md">    {/* 0px, draws a visible edge */}
    <div className="… px-4 py-2.5 border-b">             {/* row: px-4 is its ONLY gutter */}
```

Here the row's `px-4` is load-bearing -- gating it puts the text flush against the border.
The excess inset belongs to the card, but the card is NOT what yields: halve the card's inset
below `md` and pull the pane out by exactly that amount, on the shell the pane and its
loading skeleton share so the layout does not jump when data arrives. The two numbers
are ONE number -- changing the inset without the margin pushes the pane past the border:

```tsx
const PANE_SHELL_CLASS = 'flex gap-3 -mx-2.5 md:mx-0 …'  /* cancels `Card`'s own px-2.5 */
```

Measured at 390px on the Skills tab: the pane goes from left 37 / width 316 to left 17 /
width 356, so a row inside it starts at ~33px instead of ~54px, against 20px for the same
text in chat.

**Do not flush the card itself** (a `px-0` override). Its padding is also the only gutter the
toolbar above the pane has, and removing it puts the search field's rounded border
directly against the card's border -- measured as a 0px gap, and the first thing a reader
calls ugly. `Card`'s own narrow inset (`px-2.5`, a measured 10px) keeps the field off the border
while giving the row back most of the width. An inset toolbar above a full-bleed list is the ordinary phone pattern; the
two do not need to share a left edge.

This does not touch the page container's `px-2 md:px-6 pb-8`, which is what `AUTOSDE.yaml`'s
`page-layout-pattern` names and is not the layer to change. For a pane that must reach the
SCREEN edge, past the page gutter, cancel more inside the pane (`-mx-6` while narrow).

**Status: a direction, not a description of the repo.** Two shapes are migrated --
`SkillContextBudget` (direct-child rows) and the `SkillsTab` / `SteeringTab` split panes
(card flush). A scan for `className="…px-4…py-2"` under `website/src/pages` matches ~27
rows across 15 files, but a hit is not a work item: most are toolbars, banners, sticky
bars and buttons that own the only gutter their content has, and rows inside a bordered
pane must keep theirs. There is no lint gate for this. Read the structure around a hit
before gating it, and see kirodotdev/KiroCrew#3939 for the triage of all 27.

## Stat cards

OPTIONAL summary metrics above the content. Add a row only when a number is not
already visible in the content below it: a rolled-up total, a rate, an error
count. Do NOT add one that restates `items.length` for a list rendered on the
same screen; it costs roughly 90px above the fold and carries no action. A page
with no stat card row is conformant.

```tsx
<div className="grid gap-3.5 grid-cols-[repeat(auto-fit,minmax(150px,1fr))] mb-6">
  <StatCard label="Total" value={count} accent />
  <StatCard label="Active" value={active} />
</div>
```

`StatCard` renders a pulsing skeleton when `value` is `undefined` or `null`, so
pass the query result straight through instead of branching on a loading flag.
Pass `delay` (in ms) to join the grid's stagger. Give it `onClick` only when the
card is really actionable; it then wires `role="button"`, `tabIndex` and
Enter/Space itself.

## Data sections

`Card` + `CardTitle` + `InfoTip`:

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardTitle>Section Name <InfoTip text="Explanation." /></CardTitle>
  <SearchInput placeholder="Filter…" value={filter} onChange={…} />
  {items.length === 0
    ? <EmptyState icon={<Anchor className="lucide-inline" />} title="None yet" />
    : <table className="w-full border-collapse table-striped">…</table>}
</Card>
```

Inside a **side panel**, a counted list-section header is `PanelSectionHeader`
(label + count node + hairline rule), never a hand-rolled one. Hierarchy comes
from weight and size, never from an opacity modifier, and the label is not
uppercased (`text-transform` is a no-op on CJK).

## Tables

Striped body, one header cell style:

```tsx
<th className="text-left text-muted text-[12px] uppercase tracking-[.04em] px-2.5 py-2 border-b border-border font-medium">
```

`table-striped` shades even rows with `var(--card-hl)`.

## Forms

Inline within a `Card`, built from the shared primitives:

- `Input` for text fields.
- `SendBtn` for the primary action (accent-colored).
- `Btn` for secondary actions, `Btn danger` for destructive ones.
- `Checkbox` from `ui.tsx` for a boolean box.
- **Dropdowns: never a native `<select>`.** Its popup is drawn by the OS, so it
  ignores every theme token, cannot be styled per row, and looks nothing like
  the rest of the app. Pick by list length and purpose:
  - `SettingsSelect` (`components/settings.tsx`) on a Settings page — label +
    description + dropdown as one field. The choke point for that surface.
  - `SimpleSelect` (`components/SimpleSelect.tsx`) anywhere else, up to roughly
    fifteen options. Radix Select under the hood; takes `options` /
    `optionLabels` / `value` / `onChange(value)`, and `action` for a trailing
    "+ New…" row.
  - `SearchableSelect` (`components/SearchableSelect.tsx`) past that, or any
    list a user would want to filter (timezones, file lists). Radix Popover plus
    a filter box.
  - `DropdownMenu` (`components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`) for a menu of *commands*
    rather than a bound value.
  - `AgentSelector` for agent dropdowns specifically (portal-based, ARIA-wired).

  These render a `<button>`, not a `<select>`, so an external
  `<label htmlFor>` does **not** name them — pass `aria-label`.
- `Toggle` for a boolean switch. It carries `role="switch"`, `aria-checked` and
  `aria-disabled` itself, so do not re-add them.

## Status indicators

- `Badge variant="ok" | "err" | "warn" | "aim" | "muted"`.
- `SourceBadge source="…"` for provenance (where an agent, app, or skill came
  from). It maps known sources to colors and falls back to a neutral pill for an
  unknown one, so pass the raw source string.

## Errors

A dismissible banner above the content:

```tsx
<div className="mb-4 bg-danger/10 border border-danger/20 rounded-lg p-3 flex items-start gap-3 animate-rise">
```

## Animations

`animate-rise` on cards and banners, `animate-scale-in` on inline reveals. Both
are Tailwind utilities defined in `tailwind.config.js`, and both use
`backwards` fill so an `animationDelay` holds the element hidden until its turn.

## Do NOT

- Wrap a page in `<div className="p-6 max-w-[960px] mx-auto">`. Use
  `PageHeader` + the `px-2 md:px-6 pb-8` container.
- Use a raw `<input>` / `<button>`. Use `Input`, `Btn`, `SendBtn`,
  `SearchInput`, `Checkbox`.
- Use a native `<select>`. There is no styled wrapper for one any more — see
  §Forms for which dropdown component to reach for. Enforced by
  `no-restricted-syntax` in `eslint.config.js`.
- Use raw status text. Use `Badge` or `SourceBadge`.
- Use `text-xs`. Use `text-[13px]`.
- Add a new CSS `@keyframes`. Use Framer Motion, or an existing utility.
