/**
 * Untranslated-string gate. Two checks with different jobs:
 *
 * 1. **Lines this branch wrote — ZERO tolerance, no ledger.** A user-visible literal on
 *    an added line fails, whatever any committed number says. This is the real gate.
 * 2. **Per-file ceilings — UPWARD-ONLY.** `untranslated-baseline.json` holds the frozen
 *    debt on lines nobody touched. Going over a ceiling fails; going under does not.
 *
 * **Per file.** A single total lets three strings fixed in one file pay for three
 * added in another. Per-file counts make that visible, and turn the baseline into a
 * worklist: `Phase 1` is "drive these files to zero", which can be sliced into
 * reviewable PRs by file.
 *
 * ## Why the ledger stopped being the enforcement mechanism
 *
 * The gate shipped bidirectional: a count that dropped *below* its baseline also failed,
 * so whoever fixed a string had to commit the smaller number and the gain could not be
 * given back. Two problems, in increasing order of seriousness.
 *
 * The first is contention. This baseline is one generated artifact holding a `_total`
 * plus 269 per-file entries, regenerated from a whole-tree scan. Forcing every improving
 * change to re-snapshot it means two branches that fix strings in *different* files
 * still conflict textually, in `_total` if nowhere else, and every merge to `main`
 * invalidates the number in every other open branch — serialisation imposed by the
 * ledger, not by the code being changed.
 *
 * The second is that the downward guard did not actually prevent regressions. It
 * required an *edit*, and the edit is one command. `195904c` shipped a new app with 113
 * untranslated strings and moved `_total` from 1747 to 1860 inside a 5,942-line diff,
 * under the fully bidirectional gate, and CI was green — because re-snapshotting makes
 * the live count agree again and the hunk reads like routine ledger churn. A guard whose
 * bypass is `--update` protects only against forgetting.
 *
 * So the strict check moved to the diff, where there is no number to regenerate, and the
 * ceilings became upward-only. That is a net tightening: `195904c` fails check 1 today.
 *
 * **The ultimate goal is zero for every file here.** A ceiling of 0 has nothing left to
 * decrease, so "only an increase fails" IS the strict gate; when the last file reaches 0
 * this baseline is deleted and the check becomes an unconditional "no untranslated
 * strings". Phase 1's stated goal was always "drive these files to zero" — the
 * relaxation only removes the obligation to re-snapshot on the way there. Tracked in
 * issue #1004.
 *
 * Residual cost, stated: a ceiling drifts above reality between snapshots, so an
 * UNTOUCHED file could in principle give a fixed string back through some path that
 * writes no new line. Check 1 covers everything a branch writes; nothing covers a file
 * nobody edits, which is also a file nobody can regress.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-strings.mjs            # gate
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-strings.mjs --update    # re-snapshot the ceilings
 *   I18N_BASE_REF=origin/main node scripts/check-i18n-strings.mjs
