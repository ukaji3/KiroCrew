/**
 * Build-time asset pre-compression.
 *
 * The gateway serves the SPA over HTTP and does NOT compress responses — a fact
 * Kiro Crew's own SSH-tunnel code documents as the reason `ssh -C` exists
 * (`src/kiro_crew/instances/constants.py`, `ssh_tunnel_manager.py`). A cold
 * dashboard load therefore transfers ~7.8 MB of uncompressed JS, which is felt
 * as lag whenever the dashboard is reached over a tunnel or a slow link.
 *
 * aiohttp's `FileResponse` already solves the serving half: it looks for a
 * `<file>.br` then `<file>.gz` sibling, and if the client's `Accept-Encoding`
 * allows it, serves that file with the right `Content-Encoding` and
 * `Vary: Accept-Encoding` — keeping the zero-copy sendfile path. So no server
 * code is needed; the build just has to emit the siblings.
 *
 * SCOPED TO CONTENT-HASHED ASSETS ON PURPOSE. aiohttp performs no staleness
 * check: if a sibling exists it is served blindly, even if it is older than the
 * file next to it. Vite's content-hashed `dist/assets` filenames make that safe
 * (a changed chunk gets a new name, so a stale sibling is simply never
 * requested), but stable-named files served by the gateway's other static
 * mounts — `/vendor`, `/fonts`, `/app-assets`, `index.html` — could be served
 * stale forever. Those are deliberately left uncompressed.
