/**
 * The i18n gate table, and the decision over it — a pure function so the exit code
 * can be unit-tested instead of discovered in CI.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate module
 *
 * The first version of the runner lived entirely in `i18n-check.mjs`, and it shipped a
 * hole that two independent reviewers found and reproduced: a script that exited
 * non-zero BEFORE printing any line a row recognised made every row it owns `NOT RUN`,
 * `NOT RUN` was excluded from the failure set, and the `unexplained` guard written for
 * exactly that case was switched off by the very rows it should have caught. The runner
 * exited 0 where the `&&` chain it replaced exited 2 — eslint failing to load, an
 * unresolvable `I18N_BASE_REF`, a catalog that did not parse. A gate that stops
 * guarding silently is the defect this whole change exists to remove, and it was
 * reachable because the verdict was a chain of filters nothing could test.
 *
 * So the verdict is a function over plain data, and `i18nGateTable.test.ts` pins the
 * invariant that matters: **a non-zero child always fails the run**, whatever the rows
 * say. Row states are for ATTRIBUTION — telling the author which check to look at —
 * never for deciding whether the step passes.

 * The thirteen checks, in reading order within their section.

 * `find` pulls the numbers out of the owning script's output on the PASSING path;
 * `whenFailed` does the same for the failing path, because most of these scripts print
 * a different sentence when they fail and `find` would simply not match.
 *
 * `ok` decides the row from the captured numbers; omit it and the row inherits the
 * script's exit code, which is right for a script hosting exactly one check.
 *
 * `enforce: 'info'` marks a whole-repo measurement that CANNOT fail the step. Those
 * scripts print a `[<id>] REPORT:` line instead of exiting non-zero, so an info row is
 * PASS whenever it was measured at all — see `resolveRows`.
 *
 * `scope: 'diff'` also means "needs a base commit": with none supplied those checks do
 * not run at all, and the table says so rather than calling them broken.
