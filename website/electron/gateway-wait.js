// Pure, injectable gateway-readiness logic, extracted from main.js so it can be
// unit-tested without Electron (mirrors gateway-stop.js). main.js binds the
// real checkBackend / window / status / failure-flag to these helpers.
//
// The headline behavior is FAIL-FAST: a bundled gateway that EXITS during
// startup (e.g. ModuleNotFoundError, or SIGKILL from Gatekeeper) will never
// become healthy, so polling its port for the full timeout is dead time behind
// a misleading "Waiting for gateway…" message. As soon as the spawn watcher
// reports a terminal exit we reject immediately (~1s) and surface the cause +
// the launch log. The maxWaitMs timeout stays purely as the backstop for a
// gateway that is alive but slow to bind its port.
