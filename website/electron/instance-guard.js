/**
 * instance-guard.js — cross-app gateway ownership guard.
 *
 * The nightly app ("KiroCrew Nightly.app") and the production app
 * ("KiroCrew.app", stable ⇄ insider via the update channel) are separate
 * INSTALLS sharing ONE bundle identifier (com.amazon.kiro.crew — Finder
 * separates installs by filename; Squirrel validates updates against the
 * host's designated requirement, which pins the id), ONE data home
 * (~/.kiro/crew), and ONE gateway port (5476). That makes the port a mutex:
 * only one KiroCrew-family gateway may run at a time. Electron's
 * requestSingleInstanceLock is keyed on userData (per productName), so it
 * cannot stop "KiroCrew Nightly" launching while "KiroCrew" runs — this
 * module covers that cross-app seam.
 *
 * Decision inputs: our own stamped version (identity family derives from it,
 * mirroring auto-update.js channelForVersion), the running gateway's
 * /api/health payload ({ok, app, version}), and who LOCALLY owns the port's
 * LISTEN socket. Legacy gateways (health without identity fields) and
 * source-run dev gateways keep today's reuse behavior — the guard only
 * interposes when BOTH sides are positively identified, their families differ,
 * AND the port is held by a local KiroCrew process. That last input is what
 * separates a local rival from a REMOTE gateway forwarded in over `ssh -L`,
 * which the health payload alone cannot distinguish.
 *
 * Pure logic only — the Electron shell (main.js) owns the dialog, the
 * quit-by-name AppleScript (bundle id is shared, so targeting must be by
 * app NAME), the port-owner probe, and the port-free wait.

// The endpoint that carries the gateway's identity fields ({app, version}).
// MUST be /api/health -- the shell's liveness probe uses /api/status, whose
// payload has NO `app` field; probing it would classify every gateway as
// "unidentified" and silently disable the takeover path (caught in review).
const HEALTH_IDENTITY_PATH = "/api/health";

// The endpoint that distinguishes a SERVING gateway from one that is merely
// alive. /api/status and /api/health both keep answering 200 while the backend
// DRAINS after POST /api/shutdown, so a boot probe against either happily
// adopts a gateway that is seconds from exiting ("reusing existing gateway" →
// the gateway dies → the shell waits on a port nothing will ever answer
// again). /api/ready flips to 503 the moment shutdown_event is set, and its
// payload carries `shutting_down: true` for loopback callers.

/**
 * Classify a gateway's `GET /api/ready` answer for the boot-time
 * adopt-or-wait decision.
 *
 * Fail-open by design: only a POSITIVE shutting-down signal refuses adoption.
 * Everything ambiguous (legacy gateway without the endpoint, unparseable body,
 * transport error mapped to a null status) preserves the historical reuse
 * behavior, mirroring decideGatewayAction's every-ambiguity-reuses contract.
 *

 * @returns {"ready"|"shutting-down"|"starting"|"unknown"}
 *   "ready"         — 200: serving, safe to adopt.
 *   "shutting-down" — 503 with the shutdown marker: the gateway is draining
 *                     after /api/shutdown and will exit; adopting it strands
 *                     the shell on a dying port. Do NOT adopt.
 *   "starting"      — 503 without the marker: booting (session restore etc.);
 *                     adopting is fine, the splash already waits for ready.
 *   "unknown"       — anything else (404 legacy, proxy error, failed probe):
 *                     keep the historical adopt behavior.
