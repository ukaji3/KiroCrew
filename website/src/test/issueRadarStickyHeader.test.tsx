/**
 * The detail panes' header used to sit OUTSIDE the scroller, which made its
 * height standing furniture: 273px of an 844px phone viewport before any
 * content, for the whole session. It now lives INSIDE the scroller, so the tall
 * title leaves by physics and a sticky bar keeps the parts that must stay
 * reachable.
 *
 * Three things have to hold, and each fails differently:
 *   1. the mechanism is written ONCE and both panes render it — the previous
 *      attempt spelled ~45 lines per pane with a test pinning the copies;
 *   2. the sticky bar's height does not change between states, because that is
 *      what keeps `scrollHeight` still and makes a hysteresis band unnecessary;
 *   3. `sm:` resets everything, so a desktop keeps the static full-width header
 *      it always had.
