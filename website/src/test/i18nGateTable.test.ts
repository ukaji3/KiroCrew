/**
 * The i18n runner's verdict.
 *
 * The property under test is the one the first version got WRONG, and it is worth
 * naming because two independent reviewers found it and reproduced it: a script that
 * exited non-zero BEFORE printing any line a row recognised had every row it owns
 * classified as an unknown, unknowns were excluded from the failure set, and the run
 * exited 0 where the `&&` chain it replaced exited 2. Reachable three ways in this
 * repo — eslint failing to load, an unresolvable `I18N_BASE_REF`, a catalog that did
 * not parse — and each is a case whose own docstring says a gate that cannot run must
 * fail, not pass.
 *
 * It was reachable because the verdict was a chain of filters over live subprocesses
 * that nothing could test. It is a pure function now, and this is the test.
