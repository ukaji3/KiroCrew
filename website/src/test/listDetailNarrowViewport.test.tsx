/**
 * Narrow-viewport list+detail drill-down.
 *
 * These shells put a fixed 240-288px list column beside the detail pane. That
 * is fine on a desktop and unusable on a phone: at 390px the detail is left
 * 40-60px of content width, which renders one or two CJK characters per line
 * and overlaps the Edit/Delete pair in the detail header. While narrow the
 * shell shows exactly ONE pane and drills down instead.
 *
 * The load-bearing case is `auto-selection does not open the detail`. Every one
 * of these shells auto-selects its first row so the desktop detail is never
 * blank, so a rule derived from "is something selected" would open the detail
 * before the user picked anything — the list would be unreachable and Back a
 * no-op, because the auto-select effect re-fires on the next render. A
 * selection-derived implementation passes every other test in this file.
 *
 * happy-dom does not do layout, so the geometry cases pin the classes that
 * select the behavior (the convention NotificationsPage.mobileScroll uses).
