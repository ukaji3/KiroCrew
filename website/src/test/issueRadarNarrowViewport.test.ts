/**
 * Issue Radar is a THREE-column shell: nav rail, list, detail. A phone cannot
 * hold three — the rail's minimum is 280px and the list's is 260px, so at 390px
 * the detail pane was left roughly 60px before any of this.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, and the test's job is to keep them wired to each other:
 *   1. the rail opts into its icon strip while narrow (`whenNarrow`), and
 *      opening it there takes the whole viewport instead of restoring 280px;
 *   2. list and detail drill down — exactly one is on screen, with a Back
 *      control, reusing the shell-agnostic `useListDetailView` primitive.
 *
 * Asserted over source. These are declaration-level facts (which element carries
 * `hidden`, whether a row handler also drills in, whether the state is written to
 * storage) and jsdom performs no layout, so a render could not measure the pane
 * widths this is really about.
