/**
 * Translator-context sidecar guards.
 *
 * `en.context.json` maps a catalog key to one sentence of translator context.
 * It exists because a short English string is often shorter than its meaning:
 * `"KB"` is kilobytes here and could read as "knowledge base" (a real feature in
 * this product) there; `"v"` is a version prefix; `"K"` is a physical keyboard
 * key that must not be translated at all; `"Get"` is a verb meaning install;
 * `"Run"` is a verb and not the noun several locales would otherwise pick. A
 * translator working from the catalog alone cannot tell.
 *
 * ## Why a sidecar and not an inline comment
 *
 * Of the mechanisms surveyed, inline context is the one that actively hurts.
 * VS Code's translation key is `message + "/" + comment`, so *adding or editing*
 * a comment orphans every existing translation of that string. GNOME/KDE reach
 * the same conclusion from the freeze side: "addition of a comment aimed for
 * translators" is exempt from a string freeze, but "adding a context marker
 * (msgctxt) is also subject to the freeze as it renders the affected string
 * 'fuzzy'". A separate file makes a description free to write, edit and improve
 * at any time — which is the only way descriptions actually get written.
 *
 * ## The opaque class is two defects wearing one shape
 *
 * Filtering the catalog to values of three characters or fewer finds 110 keys,
 * and they are not one problem:
 *
 *   - **Abbreviations, units and key caps** — `KB`, `PID`, `RSS`, `30s`, `Esc`,
 *     `v`. Legitimate strings whose English cannot carry its own meaning. These
 *     are what this file is for.
 *   - **Sentence fragments** — `of` (×7), `or` (×3), `at` (×2), `by` (×3), `· v`,
 *     `→ v`, `PR:`. These are D1: a sentence split across `{t()}` calls, pinning
 *     every target language to English clause order. The fix is to delete the
 *     key in Phase 3, not to describe it — a description would *legitimise* the
 *     fragment, and `qa.test.ts`'s bare-connector check already owns them.
 *
 * So the ratchet below excludes the fragment class and reports it separately.
 * Double-gating it here would make the two defects indistinguishable and push
 * the next contributor toward the wrong fix.
 *
 * ## Gated vs ratcheted
 *
 * Gated: no orphan entries (the failure a key rename leaves behind, and the
 * reason this file cannot become a write-only dump), descriptions are prose
 * rather than a restatement of the value, and no description is copy-pasted
 * across *different* values.
 *
 * Also gated, at zero: coverage of the opaque non-fragment class. Splitting the
 * fragments out left a set small enough to finish, so this is a hard gate rather
 * than the ratchet the plan budgeted for — every abbreviation, unit and key cap
 * in the catalog now carries context, and a new one cannot land without it. The
 * constant stays as a named number so the failure message can explain itself.
 *
 * Coverage is deliberately NOT required catalog-wide. Demanding 4048
 * descriptions produces 4048 restatements of the value, which is worse than
 * nothing: it buries the ones that carry information.
