/**
 * Language state provider — the single owner of "what language is the UI in,
 * and how does that survive a reload".
 *
 * Four things must agree, and this provider keeps them in sync:
 *   1. i18next's active language (drives every `t()` / `i18nT()` call)
 *   2. `dashboard.language` in the workspace config (server-authoritative, so
 *      the choice follows the user across browsers and the desktop app)
 *   3. `localStorage['mc-lang']` (boot fast-path — read by the inline script in
 *      index.html before React hydrates, so there is no English flash)
 *   4. `<html lang>` (screen-reader pronunciation, `:lang()` CSS, spellcheck)
 *
 * ## Why a context provider and not a plain hook
 *
 * Two independent `useState` copies of the language would desynchronise the
 * moment one of them changed: the picker in Settings would update its own state
 * and localStorage, but the remount boundary at the app root would never learn
 * about it (a `StorageEvent` does NOT fire in the tab that wrote it). One
 * provider, one state — the same shape as `ThemeProvider` and `UIModeProvider`.
 *
 * ## Why the subtree is force-re-rendered at all
 *
 * The ~250 codemod-converted call sites use the standalone `i18nT()`, which reads
 * i18next's current language but does not SUBSCRIBE to it — React has no idea
 * those components should re-render on a language change. This provider forces
 * the re-render once centrally, instead of wiring a subscription into every
 * converted call site.
 *
 * ## Why it tracks i18next's ACTIVE language, not the resolved preference
 *
 * `i18next.changeLanguage()` is ASYNCHRONOUS. Re-rendering as soon as the
 * PREFERENCE changes repaints BEFORE the catalog swap, so the tree renders the
 * OLD strings and then never re-renders (nothing else is subscribed). The visible
 * symptom: picking a language in Settings appears to do nothing until some
 * unrelated state change repaints. Tracking the `languageChanged` event means the
 * repaint happens strictly AFTER the swap — the only ordering that works.
 *
 * ## How the repaint preserves component state
 *
 * The repaint uses `cloneElement`, NOT a `key` change. Both force the subtree to
 * re-render, but a changing `key` makes React treat the element as a different
 * one and REMOUNT it — discarding component state. That is not hypothetical: the
 * theme-install URL input lives in the same Display panel as the language picker,
 * so switching language is exactly when a user would lose what they typed.
 * `cloneElement` returns a fresh element object (defeating React's
 * referential-equality bailout) while keeping type and key identical, so React
 * reconciles it as an update and state survives.
 *
 * Long-term, migrating call sites to `useTranslation()` — which subscribes
 * properly — makes this indirection unnecessary; it can be dropped once no
 * standalone `i18nT()` remains.

    //    dataclass default, true of every fresh install) and "someone chose
    //    Auto". Adopting it would therefore ERASE a real local choice on the
    //    common path: a user who picked Chinese in this browser, on a workspace
    //    whose write never landed, is reset to auto-detect on every load with no
    //    way to make it stick.
    //
    // 2. "Auto" is inherently BROWSER-RELATIVE — it means "follow the language
    //    *this* browser asks for". Propagating it as a workspace-wide instruction
    //    is incoherent: it would tell a different browser, with a different
    //    `navigator.languages`, to discard its explicit pick in favour of a
    //    preference that resolves differently there.
    //
    // Consequence, accepted deliberately: selecting Auto in browser B does not
    // reset browser A's explicit choice. A user who wants Auto in browser A
    // selects it there — which works, and is the only place that request is
    // unambiguous. Disambiguating properly would need the backend to distinguish
