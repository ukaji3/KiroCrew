/**
 * English-rendering identity guard.
 *
 * The point of this file: a ~4200-site mechanical conversion is only reviewable
 * if "did English rendering change?" is answered by a machine rather than by
 * eyeballing 258 diffs. These checks assert the properties that would break if
 * the codemod mangled a string — independently of the ~4000 existing DOM
 * assertions that already match visible English text (those are the other half
 * of the safety net; this file catches classes of damage a screen-render test
 * can miss, like a stray key or a lost placeholder).
