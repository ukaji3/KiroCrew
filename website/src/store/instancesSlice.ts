/**
 * instancesSlice — shared client state for the multi-instance header switcher.
 *
 * `warm` holds the in-memory loopback port + minted token for each connected
 * instance whose iframe is kept mounted (hide-not-unmount). It is NEVER
 * persisted and never logged — it lives only for the dashboard session. The
 * header tab strip writes it (on connect) and the viewport reads it (to build
 * iframe src + render).
 *
 * `activeId` is the instance currently filling the page body, or `null` for the
 * native dashboard (the "Local" tab). `mru` is recency order (front = most
 * recent) for K-cap eviction. `unread` is the validated postMessage relay count.
 *
 * `host` is the ONLY field written inside an embedded remote pane: the parent
 * dashboard relays the switcher model (tabs + which one is active + this pane's
 * own tunnel status + macOS traffic-light inset) down via postMessage so the
 * embedded header can render the instance switcher inline — exactly like the
 * local tab — instead of the parent stacking a second standalone strip on top
 * of the pane (option B). It is null in the top-level (non-embedded) dashboard.
