/**
 * Settings → Releases: the changelog archive, as a version list plus a detail pane.
 *
 * ## Why this is not inside About
 *
 * About states the identity of *this install* — version, licence, platform,
 * channel, update controls — and its content is bounded: it is one screen today
 * and one screen in five years. A changelog grows without limit. Nesting the
 * unbounded thing inside the bounded one is what made About's disclosure an
 * ever-growing scroll blob, so the archive is a sibling of About rather than a
 * child of it, and About links here.
 *
 * ## Why the list is short
 *
 * Rows come from {@link https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew | CHANGELOG.md}'s
 * sections plus the release the running build belongs to — nothing else. A
 * version that shipped without a section is deliberately absent, because a row
 * that cannot say anything is indistinguishable from a broken one. The running
 * build's release is the single exception: "what am I on?" is the question this
 * page is opened to answer. `kiro_crew/changelog.py` owns that rule.
 *
 * ## Why prereleases have no rows of their own
 *
 * `0.2.0-rc.1` and `0.2.0-nightly.<stamp>` are drafts of 0.2.0, not releases.
 * Both collapse onto the single `0.2.0` row, flagged in-progress, so one
 * mechanism serves both channels, nightly does not add ~4 rows a day forever,
 * and the list does not move when 0.2.0 is promoted — the row is already there
 * and merely loses the flag. Which RC you are on is stated in the detail pane.
