/**
 * SubagentRunCard — a persistent, clickable inline card rendered in the chat
 * message flow for a `spawn_run` tool call. Mirrors WorkflowRunCard: the
 * transient SubagentProgressBar above the composer drops as soon as a wave
 * ends (and only ever covers the slot you are viewing), so nothing in
 * scrollback records that a wave was launched. This card stays anchored to the
 * invocation that launched it.
 *
 * It subscribes to the same Redux slice the chip uses (`chat.subagents` /
 * `chat.subagentQueued`, folded from `subagent_spawn`/`tool`/`done`/`queued` WS
 * frames) for live per-agent status, and counts QUEUED agents explicitly — a
 * wave sitting behind the concurrency cap has no per-agent entry yet, which is
 * exactly the window in which the UI would otherwise look empty. Clicking opens
 * the Subagents side panel.
