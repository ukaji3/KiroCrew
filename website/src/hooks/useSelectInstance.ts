/**
 * useSelectInstance — THE single owner of "switch to a pane" semantics, shared
 * by every top-level switching surface (InstanceTabBar clicks and the
 * useInstanceShortcuts keyboard chord), so the two paths can never drift:
 * a future fix to how selection/reconnect works lands in both automatically.
 *
 * Semantics (hard-won — see the inline comments):
 *  - Always activate the target so its pane shows immediately — the warm
 *    iframe if connected, otherwise the in-pane connecting/error panel.
 *  - (Re)connect when the pane has no warm iframe yet OR its live tunnel is no
 *    longer connected. The status check matters: a mid-session tunnel drop
 *    flips status to error/disconnected but does NOT clear the stale `warm`
 *    entry, so gating only on `!warm[id]` would skip the reconnect AND hide
 *    the error panel — selecting the (red) tab would do nothing visible.
 *  - A failed connect never removes the tab; the in-pane error panel shows
 *    (see InstancesViewport).
 *
 * Takes the caller's `instances` list (both consumers already subscribe to the
 * shared ['instances'] React Query cache) rather than running its own query.
