/**
 * Wire a dialog element for modal keyboard use.
 *
 * `containerRef` must point at the dialog root (the `role="dialog"` element).
 * `onEscape` is called on Escape — the caller decides whether that actually
 * closes (e.g. a dialog with work in flight can refuse).
 *
 * `enabled` exists for stacked dialogs: a dialog that opens a dialog of its own
 * must stop trapping Tab, or focus is dragged back out of the inner one on every
 * keypress. Pass `false` for as long as an inner dialog owns the keyboard.
 * Only the key handling is gated — focus-in on mount and focus-restore on
 * unmount are deliberately NOT, because tying them to `enabled` would restore
 * focus to whatever was focused before the OUTER dialog opened (i.e. behind
 * both overlays) the moment the inner one appears.
 *
 * `handleEscape` may be disabled when a caller deliberately owns Escape on a
 * bubble-phase listener. Modal uses that path so a nested overlay can consume
 * Escape before the outer dialog observes it, while this hook still owns focus
 * entry, restoration, and Tab trapping.
 *
 * The keydown listener is CAPTURE phase on purpose: dialogs stop keydown
 * propagation so the page's own shortcuts don't fire while the user types
 * inside them, and a bubble-phase listener would then never see Escape or Tab
 * from inside the dialog — breaking both dismissal and the trap.
