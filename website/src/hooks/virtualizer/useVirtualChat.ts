// useVirtualChat — measurement-first chat virtualizer hook.

// Composes HeightCache (persistent), WindowCalculator (pure window math),
// FollowController (pure stick-to-bottom decisions), and DOM observers
// (Intersection + Resize) to render a windowed view of `items`.
//
// FOLLOW / STICK-TO-BOTTOM
// ========================
// A single `stickRef` boolean is the source of truth for "keep the viewport
// pinned to the bottom". It is owned entirely by this hook (callers just use
// `scrollToBottom()` / `isAtBottom`). The decision logic lives in
// FollowController as pure functions and is race-proof against the
// ResizeObserver-vs-scroll-event ordering — see that module's header for the
// rationale. The two write sites are:
//   - automatic pins (RO callback + append layout effect) → `pinAuto()`
//   - explicit pins (slot entry + scrollToBottom API) → `forcePin()`
//
// INVARIANT — every programmatic `scrollTop` write MUST record itself in
// `lastWriteTopRef`. Read this before adding any code that moves the scroller.
//
// The stick-release guard distinguishes "the user scrolled" from "we scrolled"
// by comparing live `scrollTop` against the value we last wrote. An unrecorded
// write therefore looks exactly like user input and releases follow. The guard
// is reliable only because pins are instant, so there is no in-flight animation
// to desynchronise the reference. That makes the invariant load-bearing rather
// than hygienic: the anchor-compensation write has to honour it too, and so must
// any future one.
//
// Visual stability while scrolled up (window expansion, async widget resizes
// above the viewport) uses native CSS `overflow-anchor: auto` PLUS an explicit
// anchor-preservation pass: an upward window shift can unmount the very node the
// browser chose as its anchor, which resets anchoring and jumps the viewport, so
// the top visible row's offset is captured before the commit and `scrollTop` is
// compensated after it. The CSS is retained — reliance on it is reduced, not
// replaced.
//
// Render contract for callers:
//   - Wrap the scroll container with `scrollerRef`
//   - Render the items in `virtualItems`: when `item.mounted` is true render
//     the real component wrapped in a div with `ref={measureRef(item.index)}`;
//     when false render a placeholder `<div style={{ height: item.height }} />`
//   - Place `topSentinelRef` / `bottomSentinelRef` at the list ends for
//     window expansion.
//
// WHY THIS IS IN-HOUSE (build-vs-buy — recorded, not assumed)
// ===========================================================
// This module re-implements machinery that react-virtuoso and @tanstack/virtual
// ship battle-tested (dynamic measurement, prefix-sum offsets, follow-output
// pinning, anchor stability), so the choice to keep owning it needs to be a
// decision on the record rather than a default. The chat-specific requirements a
// drop-in library does not cover today:
//   - Widget iframes: rows contain sandboxed iframes that lose all internal
//     state on unmount and rebuild slowly (PROGRAMMATIC_BUILD_DELAY_MS), which
//     is why `isSticky` exists to exempt chosen rows from windowing entirely.
//   - Identity that is not the array index: a steered bubble's `ts` is rewritten
//     by the server echo, so height-cache identity must key on `meta.clientTs`
//     (see ChatPage `stableMsgKey`); a library keyed on index or item identity
//     would orphan the measurement.
//   - Turn regrouping: a `single` row promotes into a grouped `turn` mid-stream,
//     changing row composition without changing the underlying messages.
//   - Cross-session persistence: heights survive in localStorage per session,
//     partitioned by `sessionId`, so a revisit is warm.
// None of these is proven *fundamental* — they are integration costs, not
// impossibilities. The maintainers' open question is therefore whether to keep
// investing here or schedule a migration; this comment records the constraints
// that a migration would have to satisfy, so the next scroll fix is a choice
// rather than a default. It does NOT itself decide the direction.
