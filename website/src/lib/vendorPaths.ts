// Single source of truth for the same-origin Tailwind v4 browser runtime asset.
//
// Consumed by three sites that MUST agree, or the runtime silently 404s and
// every widget/artifact renders unstyled (would regress):
//   - src/lib/widgetSrcdoc.ts : the <script src> the sandboxed iframe loads
//   - vite.config.ts (dev)    : configureServer middleware SERVE_PATH
//   - vite.config.ts (build)  : generateBundle emit fileName
// Keeping one definition here means the consumer path can't drift from the
// dev-serve / build-emit paths.
//
// A fourth consumer reads the same asset from DISK, not this URL path:
// src/kiro_crew/publish_sync.py inlines it into published widget documents,
// which are viewed away from the dashboard origin and so cannot resolve a
// same-origin path. It resolves the build-emit location
// (static/dist/vendor/tailwindcss-browser.js) and depends on the emit filename
// below staying put.
