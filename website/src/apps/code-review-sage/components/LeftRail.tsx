// The persistent left rail: the repo dropdown, the lists it filters, then nav.
//
// Previously four stacked accordions. Three of them were not disclosures at all
// — Reviews held a status readout (now a tab + badge on the middle column) and
// Learning/Settings held one sentence of description each before navigating
// away. Collapsed drawers that only ever navigate read as clutter and cost a
// click, so the rail is now two real panels plus plain nav rows.
//
// The tabbed lists (pull requests / reviews) live here, where a third column used
// to be, under the repo picker that scopes them. Folding them into the rail
// leaves the whole rest of the window to the report, which is the widest thing
// the app renders.
