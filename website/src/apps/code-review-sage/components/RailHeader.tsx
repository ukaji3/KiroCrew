// (Reviews / Learning / Settings).
//
// It is its own component because the row is the app's ONLY navigation, and the
// rail it used to live inside disappears on a phone. While narrow the rail
// collapses to a bar across the top, and a bar that carried nothing but an
// expand glyph left the phone with no way to reach Learning or Settings from a
// report — the sections were reachable only by first reopening the rail, which
// is not a place the nav appears to be. Rendering the same row in both shapes
// keeps navigation in one fixed spot regardless of which pane owns the viewport.
//
// `leading` is the slot for the control that moves BETWEEN the two shapes: the
// back-to-list button while the bar is up, the collapse button while the rail
// owns the screen. It is a slot rather than a prop pair because only the shell
// knows which state it is in.

/** One section destination, icon-only.
 *
 * Labelled for assistive tech and on hover but not in print. Two separate reasons,
 * because the desktop rail and the phone bar do not share one:
 *
 *  - On the WIDE rail, the sections and the lists below them both had a "Reviews",
 *    stacked one above the other, which read as a repeated control. A list of
 *    reviews has the stronger claim on the word, so the section keeps the glyph.
 *    That argument is about the list being visible directly below, so it says
 *    nothing about the bar, where the list is hidden.
 *  - On the BAR it is a width decision, measured rather than assumed: at a 390px
 *    viewport the row has 374px, and a labelled three-section nav beside the
 *    labelled back control measures 452-654px in 5 of 6 locales sampled (only
 *    zh-CN fits, with zero slack). Labels would have to wrap to a second line,
 *    permanently doubling the bar's height above the report. The maintainer's
 *    ruling on that trade is to keep the nav icon-only and let a tap teach what a
 *    glyph does — so the effort went into making a tap teach: no control-shaped
 *    thing on the bar is dead (see `onReselect`), and no glyph is duplicated by
 *    the decorative app mark (see the reviews entry's icon).
 *
 * `touch` is the narrow-viewport form. The desktop rail's 27px hit area clears
 * WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8's 24px floor but is not what a touch target is built to;
 * 44px is what Apple's HIG, Fluent and Primer all recommend, and on the bar these
 * three ARE the app's navigation rather than a corner of a wide rail. */
