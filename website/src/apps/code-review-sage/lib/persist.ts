// Persistence for Code Review Sage: where you were, and what you last saw.
//
// Two separate concerns, deliberately kept apart:
//
//  1. UI STATE (this repo, this review, this tab) — small, and authoritative.
//     Restoring it means a reload or a trip through another Kiro Crew page lands
//     you back where you were instead of on an empty shell.
//
//  2. QUERY SNAPSHOTS — the last successful payload of each list, replayed on
//     mount as react-query `initialData` with its ORIGINAL timestamp. Because
//     that timestamp is already older than the query's staleTime, react-query
//     renders the cached data immediately and refetches in the background:
//     stale-while-revalidate, without a skeleton on every reload.
//
// The project has no query-cache persister (no `@tanstack/query-persist-client`
// anywhere), so this is scoped to Sage rather than adding dependencies to a repo
// that is going public.
//
// Both are best-effort: every read is guarded and every failure degrades to the
// current behaviour (default state, loading skeleton). Persistence must never be
// able to break the app — a corrupt or outdated value is discarded, not trusted.
