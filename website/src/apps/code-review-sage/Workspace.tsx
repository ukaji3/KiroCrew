 * remove, so it must not reappear in the control pointing AT the rail. Each
 * section therefore answers with its rail's own heading: reviews from the active
 * list tab, learning from the namespaces panel. A section whose rail has no pane
 * of its own falls back to the section name (and `sectionHasList` withholds the
 * control there anyway).
 *
 * A function rather than a field on RailHeader's section table, because the
 * reviews answer depends on runtime state (`listTab`) and a static key cannot
 * express it. Resolved per call so a language switch reaches it.
