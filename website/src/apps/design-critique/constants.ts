/**
 * ## Why the UI copy below sits behind GETTERS
 *
 * Every table in this module is evaluated ONCE, at import. A bare
 * `i18nT('…')` in a property position would therefore resolve against whatever
 * language happened to be active at boot and never re-resolve when the user
 * switches language — the frozen-at-import bug `lib/effort.ts` documents.
 *
 * `effort.ts` solves it by storing catalog KEYS and resolving in an exported
 * function. That shape is unavailable here: every consumer of these tables reads
 * the value POSITIONALLY (`list[i].label`, `KIND_WAIT[kind]`,
 * `sevOf(sev).label`), so moving the lookup into a new resolver would mean
 * rewriting four other modules. A getter puts the `i18nT()` call on the property
 * ACCESS instead, which is what already happens per render — same guarantee, no
 * change to any call site.
 *
 * `i18nT('<literal>')` inside the getter keeps `scripts/check-i18n-keys.mjs`
 * able to resolve the key statically, which is the property that makes a key
 * verifiable at all.
 *
 * One caveat, deliberate: `DesignCritiquePage` SPREADS a `BLOCKED` entry into
 * React state (`{ ...(BLOCKED[reason] || BLOCKED.other), detail }`). A spread
 * invokes getters, so that copy is resolved once and then held — an open blocked
 * screen keeps its boot-language text across a language switch until the run is
 * retried. See `blockedFor()` below for the one-line fix that closes it.

// The built-in example is a real 4-screen checkout flow, captured from a real

// Every box below is MEASURED from the rendered page, not estimated. Images live
// under the dashboard's public assets (copied by the build).
//
// ## Why nothing from here down is localised
//
// These two constants fill MODEL-OUTPUT slots. `showReport(SAMPLE_REPORT, …)` is
// the same entry point a finished run uses, and `FindingRow` renders `title`,
// `category`, `location`, `evidence`, `fix` and `rules` verbatim inside localised
// chrome ("Where", "What I saw", "Based on"). A real critique arrives in English —
// `prompts.ts` carries no language directive and pins the NN/g severity names — so
// translating the sample would make it the only localised report in the app and
// leave History rendering a Chinese example directly above English real ones.
//
// The content is also welded to the English PIXELS of the bundled screenshots:
// the evidence quotes button labels out of them ("Continue (dark) → Next step
// (blue) → Pay $130 (green)", 'Only Phone is annotated, as "Optional"'), and
// `SAMPLE_SCREENS[].label` captions frames whose own headings read Cart /
// Shipping / Payment / Confirmation. A translated caption over an untranslated
// screenshot breaks the evidence link the example exists to demonstrate.
//
// `FindingRow.tsx:63` also branches on `/accessib/i.test(f.category)`, an English
// regex over a category value — latent for these five categories, but it confirms
// the field is treated as an English token rather than copy.
//
// Localising the example is therefore a product decision (it depends on whether
// the critic prompt gains a language directive first), not a mechanical i18n fix.
// Reported to the shard parent rather than converted. See shard-02.json `notes`.
