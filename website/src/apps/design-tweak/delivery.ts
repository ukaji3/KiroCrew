/**
 * Delivery state for a sealed request — resolved by ASKING the session, not by
 * remembering.
 *
 * `POST /send` seals a batch server-side; the panel builds and dispatches the
 * prompt afterwards, then acknowledges. Those are three steps over two
 * processes, so a crash or a lost ack leaves a sealed request whose fate the
 * panel cannot infer from its own memory — and guessing wrong in either
 * direction is bad: guess "not sent" and a resend applies every edit twice,
 * guess "sent" and the batch is stranded.
 *
 * So don't guess. The prompt carries the request id (in the payload path and in
 * each `[cid …]`), and `POST /api/chat/slots` returns the slot's recent
 * transcript plus its pending queue. Searching those for the id is ground truth:
 * either the session has this batch or it does not.
 *
 * Pure functions, because the cost of getting this branch wrong is duplicated
 * edits in someone's repository.

 *
 * A miss is only decisive within the window the host returns (the recent
 * transcript, not all history). `deliveryVerdict` is what encodes that limit;
