// dial, and only the operator knows which side they want. So the three levers
// are user-settable, persisted with the rest of the UI state, and each one
// falls back to the constant above when unset.
//
// The bounds are the load-bearing part, and the binding constraint is NOT the one
// you would guess. A list poll does not pay for a full fetch: the route is
// probe-gated (`routes._poll_can_serve_cache`), so the steady-state cost of a poll
// is ONE search call, and the paginated refetch happens only when that probe moves
// or the 10-minute staleness ceiling fires. So the 5,000/hr *core* budget is
// comfortable — what runs out first is GitHub's **30/min SEARCH quota**, which the
// probe spends and which the user's own `gh search` shares.
//
// That quota is what sets the floor. `routes._PROBE_COALESCE_SEC` (15s) shares one
// probe reading per (repo, kind) across every open tab, so a 30s interval costs at
// most 2 probes/min/kind however many tabs are open. **The floor below is 30s
// precisely because 30 >= 2 x 15** — halve it and each kind doubles its probe rate
// while coalescing stops absorbing anything. If that backend constant ever changes,
// this floor has to move with it; nothing enforces the relationship mechanically,
// which is why it is written down here.
//
// Worst case at the floor, stated honestly: 2 probe kinds (issues + PRs) x 2/min =
// 4 probes/min for one repo, so roughly 7 repos polling at once would saturate the
// quota. A probe failure is handled (the route keeps serving cache) but is SILENT
// beyond the staleness ceiling — the app looks healthy while lists sit up to 10
// minutes stale — so this is a real ceiling, not a theoretical one.

/** Selectable list-poll intervals, in ms.
 *
 * The floor is 30s, and it is not arbitrary: see the note above — it is twice the
