// The detail panes' header, shared by the issue pane and the pull-request pane.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE
//
// The header used to sit OUTSIDE the pane's scroller, which made its height
// standing furniture: whatever it cost vertically, it cost for the whole
// session. On a phone that was 273px of an 844px viewport before any content.
// A header that lives INSIDE the narrow scroller yields that height by physics —
// the tall title scrolls away 1:1 with the finger — while two sticky rows keep
// what has to stay reachable.
//
// This is deliberately NOT a height animation. An earlier attempt kept the
// header outside and animated a collapse, which needed a hysteresis band purely
// because collapsing mutated `scrollHeight` and let the browser clamp
// `scrollTop` back down, re-expanding the header under a stationary finger.
// Sticky rows do not move the scroll height, so that whole class of problem —
// and the band, the dual-title height math, and the grid-track transition — goes
// away with it.
//
// WHY THE BACK ROW CARRIES THE TITLE
//
// The narrow back control is 44px that the pane pays for unconditionally, and at
// rest it holds one short label and a lot of empty space. Putting the compact
// title there rather than in the toolbar is what lets the toolbar be ONE row:
// state, the number and three actions fit on a 390px line only when they are not
// also sharing it with a title. Measured: 44 + 45 standing, against 44 + 76 when
// the title competed for the toolbar's row.
//
// Two sticky rows rather than one block, at `top-0` and `top-11`, so the reading
// order at rest is unchanged — back, then the tall title, then the toolbar. A
// single contiguous sticky block would have to hoist the toolbar above the title,
// which is a different pane, not a narrower one.
//
// ONE DOM SHAPE, NOT TWO
//
// The header renders in exactly one place. Which element owns `overflow` is what
// changes at the breakpoint, and that is already how these panes work: below
// `sm:` the wrapper is the single scroller (so these rows are its sticky
// children), and above it the wrapper is `overflow-visible` while the two body
// columns scroll themselves (so they are static blocks above them). Nothing is
// conditionally mounted, so there is no second structure to keep in step.
//
// SLOTS, NOT DATA
//
// The two panes disagree on their content — `StatePill` takes a close reason in
// one and draft/merged flags in the other, only the issue pane has a lock, only
// the PR pane carries a review bar — so this takes ReactNode slots and owns the
// MECHANISM only.

   *  THE ONE UNBOUNDED PART OF THE PINNED REGION. Everything else here is
   *  fixed-height by construction — that is what lets the scroll-driven state be

   *  `PrActionsBar` here so a reviewer can approve without scrolling back up,
   *  and opening one of its composers grows a textarea inside the pinned area.
   *  So the "44px in both states" measurement is the ISSUE pane's; the PR pane's
   *  pinned height is 44px plus whatever this slot is currently showing.
   *
   *  That is a pre-existing cost rather than something this design added:
   *  `PrActionsBar` already lived in this header on the base branch, where the
   *  header never scrolled away at all, so the composer sat on top of a 273px
   *  standing block instead of an 88px one. It does NOT reintroduce the
   *  hysteresis problem either — that loop needed a SCROLL-driven height change
   *  feeding back into `scrollTop`, and opening a composer is a user action, not
   *  a scroll position. Worth revisiting whether the composer should scroll
   *  normally on a phone; that is a product call, not a correctness one. */
