// Issue Radar — column 2 of the crews surface: the crew roster.
//
// Layout follows the issue and PR list columns: one rounded card per row in a
// scrolling stack under a `CREW · N` group label. The filter and sort controls
// are in the rail's Crews accordion, not here.
//
// The group-label row also carries the ONE way to hire a crew. It sits with the
// roster rather than in the main column because a crew IS a roster entry, and
// because the main column addresses a single crew — a create control there would
// disappear the moment one was selected.
