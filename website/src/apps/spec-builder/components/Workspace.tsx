// Workspace — the non-creating view: specs rail (column 1) + selected spec
// detail (chat + docs, columns 2 & 3). With no specs yet, the main area carries
// the first-run empty state.
//
// Layout follows Issue Radar's shell: full-height flush columns separated by
// borders and drag handles, no page gutters and no floating cards, so every
// column header sits on the same line. The rail's width is owned here (the
// shared useColumnResize hook, same as Issue Radar's rail) and dragging past the
// minimum collapses it to an icon strip.
//
// The RAIL STAYS MOUNTED IN EVERY STATE (Issue Radar's LeftRail convention).
// It previously unmounted on the empty state, which took the app-identity
// footer and the Settings entry point with it — so a first-run user had no way
// to reach settings, and the layout jumped the moment the first spec appeared.
//
// Detail is mounted only for a spec that is actually in the list: a selection
// restored from localStorage for a spec that no longer exists used to make
// SpecDetail fetch it and surface a raw "not found" error banner before the
// list reconciled.
