/**
 * Geometry + selection helpers for the pinned-prompt banner (the most recent
 * user prompt that has scrolled fully behind the chat fold, shown as a sticky
 * band under the session title).
 *
 * The hand-off is **bottom-edge driven**: a prompt scrolls with the transcript
 * until its bubble's BOTTOM edge reaches the bottom of the banner band, i.e.
 * until the row is entirely hidden behind the band; only then does it collapse
 * into the banner. It is then pushed out by the NEXT prompt as that prompt's top
 * border meets it (`computePinPush`) — a separate, earlier line, so a tall prompt
 * shows no banner at all while it is being read.
 *
 * Why the bottom edge and not the top (the original sticky-style rule): a prompt
 * taller than the band — an essay, a pasted stack trace — satisfies "top has
 * reached the fold" the instant it is sent, so it would collapse into a one-line
 * banner before the user could read it, and its still-laid-out (but hidden) row
 * left a prompt-sized hole above the response. Tracking the bottom edge means a
 * tall prompt stays fully readable and scrolls away line by line. For a
 * one-line prompt the two rules fire on the same pixel (its bubble height equals
 * the collapsed card height), so short-prompt behaviour is unchanged.
 *
 * The banner cannot be a real sticky element because the transcript is
 * virtualized — a row scrolled far above the window unmounts, so the sticky node
 * would vanish. Instead the banner is an overlay driven by the same math.

/**
 * How far (px) to translate the banner UP so the incoming prompt pushes it out.
 *
 * The banner's bottom edge tracks the incoming prompt's TOP edge exactly, so the
 * two never overlap: the push starts when the incoming top reaches the banner's
 * bottom (`gap === ROW_PAD_Y + bannerH`, the card's own bottom, since the card
 * sits ROW_PAD_Y below the fold) and completes when it reaches the fold
 * (`gap === 0`), by which point the card is entirely above the fold.
 *
 * The travel is therefore `ROW_PAD_Y + bannerH`, NOT `bannerH`: the card starts
 * ROW_PAD_Y below the fold, so a `bannerH` travel strands its last ROW_PAD_Y of
 * height inside the band. That was invisible while the push completed on the same
 * frame as the hand-off (the incoming card replaced it instantly), but once the
 * two lines separated for tall prompts it became a 4px strip of the outgoing
 * bubble's bottom edge parked over the incoming prompt for the whole no-banner
 * stretch — flickering in size with every sub-pixel scroll.
 *
 * Note this is a DIFFERENT line from the one that decides which prompt is pinned
 * (`pinHandoffY`, driven by the incoming prompt's BOTTOM edge), and deliberately
 * so. For a prompt taller than the band the two separate: the card is fully
 * pushed out while the prompt's top is still rising, and the prompt only takes
 * the pin later, once its bottom clears the band. The stretch between them —
 * where no banner is shown at all while the tall prompt is read — is intended:
 * the band would otherwise slide up across the prompt's own text, since by then
 * the only part of it beside the band is its last line. For a one-line prompt the
 * two lines coincide and the hand-off is instantaneous, as before.
 *
 * @param nextTop viewport-relative top of the incoming prompt row, or null when
 *                that row is not mounted (i.e. still far below the fold)

 * Total distance the banner must travel to leave the band COMPLETELY: its own

 * returns this, no part of the card is inside the band any more and ChatPage
 * drops the banner outright rather than rendering a fully-clipped one — a card
 * clipped to zero still leaves a 1-2px slice of its bottom edge under sub-pixel
 * rounding and browser zoom, parked over the incoming prompt for the whole

/**
 * Lines of prompt text the COLLAPSED card shows before clamping.

 * opening clause. Three keeps the card small enough to sit under the title
 * without dominating the viewport, and it widens the range over which the card is
 * a pixel-exact copy of the bubble it replaces — every prompt up to three lines
 * now hands over with no size change at all, where before only a one-liner did.
 *
 * Consequence for the hand-off line: a taller card pushes `pinHandoffY` DOWN,
 * which makes the pin condition (`rowBottom <= handoffY`) EASIER to satisfy, so a
 * card growing after it mounts can never invalidate the pin that mounted it. The
