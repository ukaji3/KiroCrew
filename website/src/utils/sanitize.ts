  // JWS (3 segments) and compact JWE (5 segments). Post-header segments use `*`,
  // not `+`. A `dir`/`ECDH-ES` JWE has an EMPTY Encrypted Key segment
  // (`header..iv.ciphertext.tag`), so `*` is what makes it redact whole rather
  // than truncating and leaving the ciphertext and tag on screen.
  //
  // Byte-identical to the backend alternative, deliberately, and pinned as such
  // by `test/test_redaction_mirror_parity.py`. No left boundary is used here: a
  // left boundary would stop a two-dot identifier such as
  // `keyJson.parse.value` being redacted, but that trade is
  // the wrong one: the boundary MISSES a real token whenever a renderer
  // concatenates a label straight onto it (`compact=jwt<token>`,
  // `/session/jwe<token>`), which the backend redacts. It also does not prevent
  // the commonest false-positive form, a space-preceded identifier in a stack
  // trace (`at eyJsonSerializer.deserialize.value`), which matches either way.
  // So it would buy two avoided false positives and cost two leaks. A miss is a
  // leak; a false positive is mangled display text.
  //
  // The residual false positive is therefore shared with the backend rather than
  // unique to this mirror, which keeps it ONE defect to fix in one place. Closing
  // it needs a structural test, not a boundary: decode segment one as a JOSE
  // header and require `alg`/`enc`. That belongs in the backend first, with this
  // mirror following, so it is deliberately out of scope here.
  /eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+(?:\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*){2,4}/g,
  // Two-segment dashboard link token (`base64url(payload).base64url(hmac_sig)`).
  // `security.py` carries the full derivation of both bounds and is the single
  // source for it; `test/test_redaction_mirror_parity.py` fails if this copy
  // drifts from it. The local invariant worth knowing here: the signature width
  // is PINNED (`{43}`, a property of the HMAC-SHA256 digest, not of the payload),
  // so a digest change fails a backend test loudly instead of silently disabling
  // redaction, and the payload bound is a generator-derived floor rather than a
  // guess because a guessed floor is beatable by a verbose enough identifier.
  //
  // ONE deliberate difference from the backend: its leading lookbehind boundary
  // is omitted here, and must stay omitted. Safari 16.3 and older cannot compile
  // a lookbehind. `vite.config.ts` declares no `build.target`, so the default
  // `'modules'` floor is `safari14`, and at that target esbuild rewrites the
  // literal into a `new RegExp(...)` call. That moves the failure from parse time
  // to run time, which does not help: this array is a module-level constant in
  // the eagerly loaded entry chunk, so the throw lands during module evaluation
  // and the dashboard renders blank rather than losing one feature. Verified by
  // execution, with `RegExp` patched to reject lookbehind: this shape throws on
  // import, a function-scoped one throws only when called.
  //
  // Removing a LEFT boundary cannot create a MISS, so the divergence is
  // one-directional: verified by execution, no input redacts in the backend and
  // not here. This mirror additionally catches a token a renderer concatenated
  // onto a label (`tok=jwt<token>`), which the backend's boundary makes it miss.
  //
  // The cost is the SAME mechanism, and it is not a benign extra replacement. A
  // lookbehind is zero-width, so the match still starts at an `eyJ`, but that
  // `eyJ` may be one INSIDE a preceding identifier: `keyJson<token>` matches from
  // index 1 and renders `k[REDACTED: credential]`, absorbing the identifier tail.
  // That is the same class of damage cited above as the reason the segment floor
  // was not relaxed to `{1,4}`. It needs an identifier containing `eyJ` glued with
  // no delimiter to 96+ identifier chars, a dot, then exactly 43 more. Not
  // reachable on the surfaces this function feeds: the longest `eyJ`-containing
  // identifier in the tree is 50 chars, the backend already redacts `agent`/`task`
  // before broadcast and truncates `tool` to 80 chars, and the output of this
  // function goes to in-memory store state only. The one surface rewritten before
  // persistence (file-diff chip bodies) is redacted in the BACKEND, so an
  // over-match here cannot reach disk.
  //
  // Ordering after the JWS alternative is defensive, not load-bearing for real
  // tokens: a conventional `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}` header is only 33 chars
  // past `eyJ`, far below this alternative's first-segment floor, so it cannot
  // match a real JWS's `header.payload` at all. It becomes load-bearing only for
  // a JWS whose header clears that floor AND whose payload is exactly 43 chars,
  // because this pattern's right boundary is satisfied by a `.` and would leave
  // `.signature` rendered. That shape is covered by a test.
