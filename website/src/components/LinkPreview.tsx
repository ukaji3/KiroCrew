 * The favicon is decorative and carries `alt=""`, so it is not announced.

 * Fixed-size favicon box.

 * icon never reflows the surrounding text — the space is reserved before the
 * bytes arrive. `onError` swaps the `<img>` for the placeholder rather than
 * leaving the browser's broken-image glyph in a 14px slot.
 *
 * The box paints NO background of its own by default. Favicons are routinely
 * transparent PNG/ICO, so a tinted fill here shows through as a themed plate
 * around the logo — on a light theme it reads as a grey square the site did not
 * ship. Letting the surface behind it (the card, the chip's own tint, the
 * paragraph) show through is what makes a transparent icon look like the site's
 * icon.
 *
 * The exception is an icon that CANNOT be seen against that surface. A site
 * shipping one tab-coloured icon (a near-black glyph, designed for a white
 * browser tab) renders as an invisible shape on a dark theme. Two things answer
 * that, in order of preference:
 *
 * 1. If the site declares a `prefers-color-scheme: dark` variant, render THAT
 *    on a dark surface — the icon its designer drew for this case beats anything
 *    inferred here.
 * 2. Otherwise, when the measured icon and the measured surface collide, paint
 *    `--text` behind the icon — the one token every theme guarantees to contrast
 *    with its own backgrounds, which makes it correct in both directions: a
 *    light plate under a dark icon on a dark theme, a dark plate under a light
 *    icon on a light one.
 *
 * The surface is measured FIRST and independently of the icon, because it is
 * what decides which variant to render; the tone is measured from whichever
 * variant that produced.
