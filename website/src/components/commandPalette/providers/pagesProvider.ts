 * Source of truth is the surface registry (`src/surfaces/registry.ts`) — the
 * very same `getAdvertisedSurfaces()` list `App.tsx` renders the left rail from —
 * so newly registered rail destinations show up here for free and we never
 * duplicate the rail by hand.
 *
 * The rail does not cover every routed destination, however. A handful of
 * pages have routes in `App.tsx` but no rail surface (some are redirects into
 * Settings). Those are enumerated in {@link EXTRA_PAGES} below so they remain
 * reachable from the palette. This is the only hardcoded data here, and it is
 * deliberately the *non-rail* routes — adding a new rail surface still requires
 * zero changes to this file.
 *
 * Per the §2 Enter matrix, Pages are pure navigation targets: Enter navigates
 * and there is no ⌘Enter (new session) or ⌥Enter (preview) variant, so
 * `onCmdActivate` / `onAltActivate` are intentionally left unset.
