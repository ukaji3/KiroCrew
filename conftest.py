"""Repo-root pytest configuration: the host-mutation floor.

``test/conftest.py`` holds the bulk of the suite's isolation, but it only applies
to ``test/``. ``[tool:pytest] testpaths`` also collects ``transfer`` and
``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins`` (~108 test modules that ship inside the package,
next to the code they cover), and those get no ``test/conftest.py`` fixtures at
all -- only this file, plus that app's own ``tests/conftest.py`` where one exists.
Anything that must hold for EVERY test therefore has to live here, at the
rootdir, which is the one conftest pytest applies to all three testpaths.

Only the HOST-MUTATION FLOOR belongs in this file: the guards that must hold for a
test collected from any of the three testpaths, because what they protect is the
developer's machine rather than the correctness of one suite. Everything that is
merely suite-specific isolation stays in ``test/conftest.py``.

The floor has four parts, and each one exists because the "remember to isolate
this" contract failed at least once:

* **Services.** ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is redirected and the stdlib spawn funnels
  refuse a ``systemctl``/``launchctl`` invocation carrying a mutating verb, so no
  test can reconfigure or restart the operator's real gateway (issue #1722).
* **The data home.** ``KIROCREW_HOME`` is pinned per test, and the ``~/.kiro``
  paths that production binds at IMPORT time (which the env var cannot reach) are
  pinned with it. Without this, the ~108 test modules that ship inside the package
  under ``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/*/tests/`` -- which see this conftest and no
  other -- write the operator's live ``~/.kiro/crew`` the moment they touch
  ``config_dir()``.
* **The system temp directory.** ``tempfile``'s base is redirected to a per-run
  directory for the whole process, so a bare ``mkdtemp()`` whose cleanup is missing
  or skipped leaves its directory somewhere this run owns and removes, instead of
  accumulating in the shared temp root forever. What was left behind is REPORTED
  first, so the leak is a red rather than silent inode consumption.
* **The repository checkout.** The run fails when it ends with residue anywhere in
  the checkout, which is how a subprocess spawned without ``cwd=`` announces
  itself.

One consequence of living at the rootdir: the module name ``conftest`` is now
resolvable from the repository root as well as from ``test/``, and 11 test modules
import helpers by bare name (``from conftest import requires_git``). Under pytest's
default ``prepend`` import mode each test module's own directory goes on
``sys.path`` first, so those imports still bind to ``test/conftest.py`` -- but the
name IS shadowed, so switching to ``--import-mode=importlib`` would need those
imports made explicit first. The visible effect today is that isort now classifies
``conftest`` as first-party (a root-level module is inside its default
``src_paths``), which is why this change also reorders that import in the modules
that use it.

Why this floor exists (issue #1722): a test asserting that a staged cutover can
be *cancelled* rewrote the operator's real ``kirocrew-gateway.service`` drop-in
to point at its own pytest temp dir. pytest deleted the temp dir at the end of
the run; the drop-in survived, so systemd looped on ``203/EXEC`` — 548 failed
starts over 25 minutes. The test never intended to touch the host: it called the
real ``_make_live()`` because that function was the subject under test, and two
of that function's seams (the drop-in path and the subprocess layer) were left
for each test to remember to stub.

The fixtures below remove that "remember to" from the contract. None of them
changes the behaviour of a test that already isolates itself correctly: every one
sets a value a test can still override, and a test that sets its own
``KIROCREW_HOME`` or its own temp dir keeps winning.

Imports at MODULE level are stdlib + pytest only, on purpose: a rootdir conftest is
imported before every collection, so pulling ``kiro_crew`` in here would make the
whole suite depend on import-time side effects of the package under test. The
fixtures that do need ``kiro_crew`` import it in their own body, which runs at test
setup -- by which point the test module has already imported the package anyway --
and tolerate an ImportError so a partial checkout cannot break collection.

#:   to apply cgroup resource limits, so denying it would refuse an ordinary

#:   passes ``systemctl restart`` as the wrapped command, which this guard
#:   catches on the inner token instead.

    Every binding is patched rather than just the canonical one, because both
    consumers import by value: ``dev_fleet.gateway_service`` holds its own
    ``PLIST_PATH`` and its own ``launchd_live_program`` reference, and
    ``LaunchdBackend.live_program()`` calls that function fresh on each use instead
    of reading the constant.

    ``gateway_service`` is patched only when it is already imported. It is a heavy
    module and forcing it in for all ~31k tests would cost more than it protects; a
    test that imports it later binds from the already-patched ``service.macos``, so
    it inherits the tmp paths anyway.

    developer's live gateway even when the drop-in they read is pristine, so the
    second half of the floor has to be an execution guard.

    Patched at the deepest stdlib funnels rather than at the names call sites
    happen to use, so the guard cannot be bypassed by import style:

    * ``subprocess.Popen.__init__`` — every sync spawn funnels here, including
      ``run``, ``check_call`` and ``check_output``, and including a module that
      did ``from subprocess import run`` (that ``run`` still resolves ``Popen``
      through its own module globals).
    * ``BaseEventLoop.subprocess_exec`` / ``subprocess_shell`` — every
      ``asyncio.create_subprocess_*`` funnels here, so patching these also covers
      ``from asyncio import create_subprocess_exec``.
    * ``os.execve`` — ``live_target.maybe_reexec()`` execs into another checkout,
      which would REPLACE the pytest process with a real gateway. Guarded
      unconditionally: no argv inspection makes that sane in a test.

      ``os.execv`` is deliberately NOT guarded. The two exec paths in this
      codebase use different funnels, and the difference is load-bearing:
      ``maybe_reexec`` needs ``execve`` because it hands the gateway a modified
      environment across the exec, while ``spawn/exec_shim`` uses ``execv``
      precisely because it passes its inherited environment through untouched
      ("execv, not execve: the environment this process was given IS the
      environment the caller built"). The shim's exec also happens in a CHILD
      process (it is spawned as ``python -c <shim source>``), so trapping
      ``execv`` here protects nothing and only breaks the shim's in-process unit
      tests of its own 127-on-exec-failure contract.
      ``test_host_service_guard.py`` ratchets the assumption that
      ``live_target`` still execs through ``execve``.

    The mechanism follows ``test/test_update_git_guard.py``, which already
    monkeypatches ``create_subprocess_exec`` to raise on an unwanted spawn. The
    difference is scope: this one is autouse, so it holds for tests nobody
    thought to write a guard for.

    Everything else is delegated to the real implementation untouched — which
    matters more than it sounds, because ``sandbox`` wraps nearly every spawn in
    this codebase in ``systemd-run --scope`` for cgroup limits. A guard keyed on
    binaries rather than verbs refused ``git config``.

    fixed tests get their line deleted, and anything NOT on the list still fails the
    job, so the Windows line holds for the tests that pass today.

    Lives HERE rather than in ``test/conftest.py`` because the list already names node
    ids under ``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/auto_improvement/tests/``, and a hook rooted
    at ``test/`` is never registered when only in-package tests are collected -- which is
    exactly what CI's reduced-scope Windows job does when a diff touches no path under
    ``test/``. Those entries are also absent from ``BACKEND_DESELECTS``, so they were
    collected unskipped and the shard went red for a gap that was already tracked.

    The list file itself stays under ``test/``, read by path from here. Node ids are
    always spelled with ``/`` even on Windows, so the in-package entries need no

    AUTOSDE forbids a bare ``tempfile.mkdtemp()`` / ``TemporaryDirectory()`` whose
    destruction is not registered in the same scope, because those directories
    survive the run and accumulate across runs until they exhaust inodes -- MEASURED
    on this host, a ``/tmp`` tmpfs with a fixed 1,048,576-inode budget starts
    returning ENOSPC to unrelated processes with 90% of its BYTES still free.
    Enforcing that per call site is a contract every new test has to remember, and
    the shape that breaks it is invisible when reading the test:
    ``unittest.TestCase`` tearDown does NOT run when setUp raises, so a ``setUp:
    mkdtemp()`` paired with a ``tearDown: rmtree()`` leaks on every setUp failure --
    and it is the FAILING run, the one nobody is watching closely, that leaves the
    residue.

    Redirecting the base fixes the class instead of the call sites: whatever the suite
    creates without cleaning up lands in one directory this fixture owns, so the teardown
    can both NAME it (residue is still a defect) and REMOVE it (so the accumulation stops
    regardless of whether anyone acts on the report).

    The report WARNS by default and fails only under ``KIROCREW_TMP_RESIDUE_STRICT`` --
    see ``_TMP_RESIDUE_STRICT_ENV`` for why that is a staged rollout and not a shrug.

    Under ``-n auto`` each xdist worker is its own process, so each gets its own
    root and reports only its own leaks; the controller runs no tests and creates
    none.

    **A run only ever deletes the root it created itself.** There is deliberately no sweep
    of other roots, and that is a design decision rather than an omission. Reclaiming a
    root left by a killed run means deciding that some OTHER directory is abandoned, and
    every available signal for that is unsound: the name can be pre-created by another
    local account, and a pid is meaningless across PID namespaces -- two containers sharing
    a bind-mounted temp directory can each hold the same pid, so "that process is gone" is
    a statement about the wrong namespace and the reward for getting it wrong is deleting
    a live run's data. The platform already owns this job (``systemd-tmpfiles`` on a timer,
    macOS's periodic cleanup, and a tmpfs cleared on reboot), and it owns it with
    information this process does not have. So a run killed before its teardown leaves one
    directory behind for the platform to reclaim -- bounded, and far smaller than the
    375,780-inode-per-run accumulation this redirect removes.

    **Why the platform's own temp dir rather than pytest's ``basetemp``.** Nesting
    under ``basetemp`` would have been tidier -- pytest already prunes it -- but it
    adds ``pytest-of-<user>/pytest-<n>/popen-gw<k>/`` to the front of every
    ``mkdtemp()`` path in the suite, roughly 60 characters. Windows still caps a
    path at 260 unless long paths are enabled, and a macOS ``AF_UNIX`` ``sun_path``
    is capped at ~104 bytes, so that nesting would trade an inode leak for a
    platform-specific path-length failure. A sibling of the platform temp root named
    ``kc-pytest-<pid>`` is SHORTER than what pytest's own ``tmp_path`` already
    hands out, so no existing path gets longer on any platform.

    Two things deliberately stay outside the redirect:

    * ``test/tmpdir_helpers.short_tmp_base()`` forces ``/tmp`` on POSIX, because
      macOS's per-user temp root alone already exceeds the ``AF_UNIX`` cap. Those
      sites clean up after themselves.
    * A test that patches ``tempfile.gettempdir`` or passes its own ``dir=`` still
      wins, as it should.

    resolved at that moment. Two consequences, and the second is why this belongs at
    the rootdir rather than in ``test/conftest.py``:

    * Every event any test emits through the default ``sel()`` appends to ONE file.
      Unredirected that is the operator's real ``security_events.jsonl`` -- a
      non-atomic append, shared across xdist workers.
    * Whichever test calls ``sel()`` FIRST fixes the directory for the whole
      process, and the writer thread keeps using it after that test ends. When the
      first caller is a test whose home is a per-test tmp dir, the thread outlives
      the tmp dir and RE-CREATES it on the next flush -- ``_flush_batch`` opens with
      ``self._dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)``. So the directory reappears
      *after* the test's own cleanup removed it, and no amount of tidying in the
      test can win against a thread that rebuilds the path. MEASURED: this is
      exactly what left one stray ``mkdtemp`` directory behind per run of the
      ops-mission-control suite. Full telling:
      ``docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md`` § Rules.

    Session scope is what fixes both: the thread's directory is stable for the whole
    run and belongs to no individual test, so nothing deletes it underneath the
    writer, and the thread is not churned per test.

    Patches the ``_default_dir()`` accessor rather than a captured constant, because
    the module resolves its default lazily so that importing ``kiro_crew.sel`` never
    triggers the one-time data-home migration as an import side effect. Tests that
    manage their own ``SecurityEventLog`` (passing ``base_dir`` and resetting
    ``_instance``) are unaffected.
