"""``kirocrew bench`` -- external memory benchmarks (LongMemEval, LoCoMo).

A separate command from ``kirocrew eval`` because they answer different questions.
``eval`` runs four hand-written scenarios carrying nineteen substring assertions in
a single pass: a fine smoke test, and a poor instrument for "did this change help",
since one flipped assertion out of nineteen is indistinguishable from sampling
noise and sampling cannot be pinned (no ``temperature`` or ``seed`` is threaded
through the provider stack). ``bench`` measures thousands of questions with gold
evidence against the real ``VectorMemoryStore``, and its primary ruler is
deterministic, so a delta is exact.

Thin CLI layer by design: argument handling, guard messages and output only. The
measurement lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.eval.bench`.
