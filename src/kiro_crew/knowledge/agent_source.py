"""The agent's write path into the Knowledge Library.

Documents the agent comes across during normal work -- a design doc it fetched
from a wiki, a spec someone linked, a page it read to answer a question -- land
in ONE aggregate source named "Auto-added" (``source_type="agent"``, uri
``agent://``), exactly as auto-ingested artifacts land in one "Artifacts"
source.

The aggregate matters for control, not tidiness. A source row gives the user
attribution ("where did this come from?"), one-click bulk removal, and -- via
``agent_item_state`` -- per-document state so one document can be replaced or
removed without touching the rest. Loose items with no owning source row can
never be undone.

This replaces the never-built server-side doc-link scanner. Rather than Kiro Crew
regex-matching links in chat and fetching them unattended -- which needs an SSRF
host allowlist and still fetches under no one's supervision -- the agent reads
the document with its own tools, under its own approval, and hands over text.
Kiro Crew fetches nothing, so ``knowledge.doc_ingest_hosts`` does not apply here;
it stays scoped to the server-fetch path.
