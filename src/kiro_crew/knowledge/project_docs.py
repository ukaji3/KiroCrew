"""Auto-registration of project directories as document Knowledge sources.

A directory the user is actually working in -- the project dir of a live chat
slot -- is registered as a watched ``local_folder`` source restricted to
documents by :mod:`kiro_crew.knowledge.doc_filter`, so a project's design docs,
specs and READMEs become searchable without the user adding the source by hand.

Two things make this safe to do without the confirmation step the manual
folder-add path uses:

* The manual path confirms because an unfiltered folder walk is unbounded --
  it will happily ingest a repository's source code. The document filter plus
  a per-sweep chunk budget makes the walk bounded, so the gate is unnecessary
  rather than skipped. The source is seeded ``sync_status: "active"`` for the
  same reason :mod:`kiro_crew.knowledge.autosource` does: no user is present
  to confirm.
* Dismissal is after-the-fact instead of before: deleting an auto-added source
  writes a tombstone (``dismissed_auto_sources``) that survives the delete, so
  a source the user removes never comes back.

The trigger is a slot's project dir rather than observation of which files the
agent read. "You are working in this project" is a stronger relevance signal
than "I read one file there", and it needs no new observation machinery --
the gateway already persists per-slot project dirs.
