"""Auto-ingest local artifacts into the Knowledge Library.

Content-bearing local artifacts (markdown/text documents the user saves and
iterates) are mirrored into the Knowledge Library so they become searchable and
stay in sync as the artifact changes, and are removed when the artifact is
deleted. Off by default, opt in with ``knowledge.auto_ingest_artifacts``.

Design (plugs into the existing Knowledge source framework rather than adding a
parallel watcher):

* **One aggregate "Artifacts" source** -- a single ``sources`` row of
  ``source_type="artifact"`` (uri ``artifact://``) that appears in the dashboard
  Sources UI like the user's folder/upload sources. Items are grouped
  per-artifact (keyed by slug) in a dedicated ``artifact_item_state`` table --
  the same item-group pattern a folder source uses per file -- so one artifact's
  items can be replaced on edit or removed on delete without touching the rest.

* **Event-driven, no polling.** The gateway is the only process that writes the
  artifact store (the agent's MCP tools, the CLI, the dashboard, and bookmarks
  all HTTP-proxy to the gateway's ``/api/artifacts`` routes; the publishing
  provider pull/clone also funnel through the store). So a single in-process
  change-listener registered on :class:`~kiro_crew.artifacts.ArtifactStore`
  observes every write path. ``upsert`` -> ingest/replace the artifact's item
  group; ``delete`` -> remove it.

* **First-enable backfill tied to source-row creation.** The feature is opt-in,
  so when it is switched on the store already holds every artifact created
  before the listener existed. The one-time pass that ingests them is tied to
  the *creation of the aggregate source row*: when :func:`ensure_artifact_source`
  actually creates the row (its existence is the idempotency marker), the
  backfill runs once. On every later boot the row already exists, so nothing
  re-runs.

Content (and the artifact name used as the source title) are redacted for
credentials/exfiltration URLs before they cross into the store, and file-backed
artifacts whose ``source_path`` resolves to a sensitive path are refused.
