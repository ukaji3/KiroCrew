        Every chunk of a document carries the document's whole-text

        already stored. Refusing the write here -- rather than writing it and

        a chunking pass plus an LLM extraction call per chunk. It covers every

        A hit inside *source_id* itself is not a duplicate: that is the same
        document being re-ingested, which must proceed so its item group is

        superseded text searchable, and (for a folder file, whose state row is
        then recorded with an empty group) leave them unreachable by the deleted-
        file path forever.

        This gate is exact-hash only, and complements rather than replaces the
        sweep: only the sweep catches a NEAR-duplicate (the same document edited
        slightly between two sources) or a duplicate that already exists, and it
        needs embeddings, so it can never run inline.

        The skip is recorded as a terminal ``ingestion_jobs`` row rather than a
        bare ``None`` return, so a caller can tell "already present" from
