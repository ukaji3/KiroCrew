"""Canonical model registry — single source of truth for model translation.

Canonical keys (e.g. ``opus-4.8-1m``) are versioned+capability identifiers used
on the wire (frontend <-> API) and in persisted ``agent.cc_model``. This module
translates canonical -> per-provider id and looks up context windows. The same
data file (``model_registry.json``) is imported by the frontend so both sides
agree without an API round-trip.

Translation boundary: canonical->provider-id happens once at the
``config.loader._claude_code`` factory; everything below uses provider ids.

Lookups are O(1): the immutable registry is indexed into precomputed dicts once
at import (canonical/alias/provider-id -> canonical key, canonical -> provider
id, canonical -> window), so the per-session / per-token-record hot paths never
linear-scan.

Unknown-handling contract: translation is identity-preserving for values the
registry does not list — ``to_provider_id`` and ``from_provider_id`` return an
unrecognized input UNCHANGED (we never rewrite an operator's explicit id).

Context windows: :func:`model_window` is the SINGLE authority every consumer
(frontend via ``/api/models``, the context/memory budget scaler, the ACP
backfill, the live meter) resolves through. Its fallback order is live
``usage_update.size`` > kiro ``--list-models`` cache (:func:`refresh_kiro_windows`,
persisted) > static registry ``window`` literal > ``[1m]`` heuristic > ``None``.
There is no silent 200k default: a genuinely-unknown window returns ``None`` and
callers substitute :data:`REFERENCE_WINDOW_TOKENS` (1M), so an unknown model is
never wrongly shrunk. Auto-compaction is percentage-driven and does NOT read
this — it must stay that way.
