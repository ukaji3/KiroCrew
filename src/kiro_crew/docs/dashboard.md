# Web Dashboard

The dashboard is a React SPA at `http://localhost:5476` (or your configured
URL). It provides chat, memory management, cron jobs, skills, agents, and
system monitoring.

## Accessing the Dashboard

- **Local**: open `http://localhost:5476` directly (no auth needed on loopback)
- **SSH tunnel**: `ssh -NL 5476:localhost:5476 <host>` then open localhost:5476
- **Remote**: type `!dashboard` in Slack to get a presigned link (HMAC-SHA256
  signed, IP-pinned, single-use token — valid for 5 minutes, session up to 6h)
- **Custom domain**: after `kirocrew setup`, optionally use `http://kirocrew.localhost:5476`
- **Custom URL**: set `dashboard.url` in config.json for non-localhost access

### Remote Access Troubleshooting

If the dashboard doesn't load after setup:
1. Confirm the gateway is running: `kirocrew status`
2. Test the API: `curl http://localhost:5476/api/status`
3. Check for port conflicts: `lsof -i :5476`
4. On remote dev desktops, you must use an SSH tunnel — the dashboard binds to
   localhost by default
5. Run `kirocrew gateway -vv` for debug output

## Pages

### Chat (`/chat`)

Multi-session parallel chat with full Markdown rendering, syntax-highlighted
code blocks, Mermaid diagrams, and clickable file paths.

- **Multiple tabs**: each tab runs its own agent session in parallel
- **Agent selection**: pick an agent before starting a chat, or switch mid-session
- **Session history**: closed sessions appear in the collapsible history sidebar
- **Resume**: click a history item to restore the full conversation
- **Notifications**: click a notification to view it in the main pane
- **Auto-titles**: sessions get auto-generated titles after a few turns
- **Edit & resend**: edit and resend previous user messages with history preserved
- **Fork session**: fork a session into a new tab with full context carried over
- **Regenerate replies**: regenerate assistant replies with variant history navigation
- **Prompt history**: ↑/↓ arrow keys navigate through previous prompts
- **Tool purpose pills**: tool call labels show purpose text, persisted across reloads
- **Batch tool rejection**: reject multiple pending tool approvals at once
- **Cancel queued messages**: cancel button for messages waiting in the queue
- **Edit queued messages**: edit a message waiting in the queue in place before it runs (order preserved)
- **iOS-style queue stack**: queued messages displayed as a visual stack
- **Streaming transcription**: live speech-to-text partials via WebSocket
- **Weighted content search**: session content search with weighted ranking
- **Memory mode**: per-session choice — persistent (default), incognito (blocks learn_add), or temporary (no memory consolidation)
- **Merge queued messages**: optionally merge queued messages into a single prompt
- **Cooperative stop**: soft-stop sends cancel first, falls back to hard kill after budget (preserves session state)
- **Tool input preview**: expandable tool input display in approval cards
- **File upload**: drag-and-drop or paperclip upload for images and non-image files (.zip, .csv, .docx)
- **Folder management**: create, rename, and organize sessions into sidebar folders with indent borders
- **Session colors**: per-session color picker for visual organization

### Overview (`/overview`)

Tabbed management console:

- **Memory**: edit preferences.md and projects.md, view daily history
- **Cron**: create/manage scheduled jobs with agent selection
- **Lessons**: view and manage learned corrections
- **Skills**: create, edit, delete skills (SKILL.md files)
- **MCP Servers**: enable/disable MCP servers and individual tools
- **Agent Config**: edit the raw kirocrew.json agent configuration
- **Prompts**: manage prompt templates and Agent SOPs
- **Slack**: Slack connection status and configuration

### System (`/system`)

Live metrics refreshing every second: CPU, memory, network, storage, host info,
load averages, process details.

### Agents (`/agents`)

Browse installed agents with full config details. View MCP servers per agent.
Edit and delete agents.

### Tasks (`/tasks`)

Autonomous task runner: start tasks from spec files, monitor step progress,
cancel running tasks. Supports multi-turn refinement.

### Logs (`/logs`)

Live gateway log stream via WebSocket. Adjustable log level
(DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR).

### Settings (`/settings`)

Dedicated settings page with General, Chat, and Display panels. Configure
agent model, approval mode, themes, font, zoom, warm pool, and MCP probe
timeout. Includes a Security panel showing live security posture (denied
commands, suspicious patterns, tool schemas, redaction paths) and
defense-in-depth architecture.

### Developer (`/developer`)

Log viewer with Virtuoso-based virtual scrolling for inspecting gateway logs
and debugging.

### Capabilities (`/capabilities`)

Overview of installed MCP tools and agent capabilities.

### Schedule (`/schedule`)

Week grid view of cron jobs with job detail panel. Visual timeline of
upcoming and past job executions.

### Channels (`/channels`)

Persistent agent channels for multi-agent collaboration. Each channel has
its own set of agents and conversation history.

### Worlds (`/worlds`)

Interactive agent visualization scenes (Mission Control, Wizard Tower,
Deep Lab, Neural Constellation, Office, Panda Den). Click agents to
start a chat session. Supports popout windows for viewing scenes while using
other pages.

### Hooks (`/hooks`)

Display agent hooks configuration. View pre/post tool hooks and message hooks.

### Apps

Browse, install, and manage Kiro Crew apps. SSE streaming install logs show
real-time progress. Apps can be dashboard-hosted, gateway-side, or external.

### Kiro Usage

Session analytics with token usage, tool call counts, and trends.

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard uses a single WebSocket connection for all real-time events:
chat streaming, status updates, notifications, slot changes, and log streaming.
Reconnects automatically with exponential backoff — no page reload needed.

## Terminal

Terminal tabs in the chat side panel host a real shell (PTY) bound to the
chat's working directory. Each session has its own WebSocket at
`/api/ws/terminal/{sessionId}`. Binary frames carry raw PTY I/O; JSON text
frames carry control messages:

| Frame | Direction | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `resize` | client → server | `{cols, rows}` | Viewport size change |
| `title` | server → client | `{text}` | Live tab title: foreground command name while one runs, else the shell cwd basename (polled ~1/s, pushed on change) |
| `cwd` | server → client | `{path}` | The shell's full live working directory (same poll, pushed on change) |
| `error` | server → client | `{message}` | Session-level failure |
| `pong` | server → client | — | Keepalive reply |

**Selection toolbar.** Highlighting text in a terminal shows a floating
toolbar with **Send to chat** and **Copy**. Send to chat appends the selection
to the chat composer draft (never overwrites the draft, never auto-sends),
annotated with a `Terminal output (path):` header — using the live `cwd`
value when the backend has reported one, else the terminal's spawn directory
— and wrapped in a code fence so the agent reads it as literal output. Copy
places the raw selection on the clipboard.

**Credential redaction.** The terminal shows exactly what your shell wrote.
The live stream is not scanned, so a token you printed on purpose
(`gh auth token`), a device-code login or presigned URL you are mid-flow on,
and high-entropy build output such as an npm `integrity sha512-…` line all
render as themselves. Nothing is gained by hiding them here: this panel is
your own interactive shell, and anything that could read it could read the
terminal app next to it.

The scan runs where the output actually leaves your machine's screen — the
selection hand-off above, the one path by which terminal output reaches the
agent. That re-scan is unconditional, has no setting to disable it, and reads
the whole contiguous selection rather than one 4096-byte read at a time, so a
credential split across a read boundary cannot slip past it.
