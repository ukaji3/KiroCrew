"""Notification bus core: payload schema v2, channel registry, delivery pipeline.

Design (see docs/request-for-change/rfc-local-notification-bus.md):

- Every notification flows through :meth:`NotificationBus.push` as a
  :class:`NotificationPayload`.
- Channels are producer-declared. Phase 1 registers only the system channels;
  app channels arrive in Phase 2 via the app manifest.
- Priorities: ``critical`` > ``default`` > ``passive``. The channel supplies a
  default; an explicit payload priority wins.
- The persisted note dict keeps the legacy ``kind`` field alongside the v2
  ``source``/``channel`` fields so existing frontend selectors keep working.
- Legacy JSONL rows (``kind`` only) are normalized at load time via
  :func:`normalize_note`; the file is never rewritten in place for migration.
