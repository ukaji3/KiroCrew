"""MCP server exposing cron tools to kiro-cli.

Runs as ``kirocrew mcp-cron`` — kiro-cli spawns it as a child process
and calls tools via JSON-RPC over stdio (MCP protocol).

Tools:
    cron_list       — list all scheduled jobs
    cron_add        — add a cron job (every/cron/at)
    cron_remove     — remove a job by ID
    cron_remove_all — remove all jobs
    cron_pause      — pause a job
    cron_resume     — resume a paused job
