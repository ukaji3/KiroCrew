"""Wire-level fake for messaging-channel vendor APIs.

Channel tests have historically faked the *client* (``FakeClient`` standing in
for ``WeixinClient`` / ``WeComClient`` / ...), which means the client's own
payload construction, header/signature building, and protocol-error parsing are
never exercised by the turn tests -- exactly the layer where the iLink QR bug
lived (``qrcode_img_content`` is a scannable URL, not image bytes; fixtures were
green while production was broken).

This module fakes ONE level down: the ``aiohttp`` session. Everything above the
socket runs for real -- client, transport, dispatcher, the shared
``messaging.dispatch`` pipeline, and the renderer -- so a test can assert on the
*actual bytes the channel would put on the wire* without any credential,
network, or vendor account.

Seam
----
Every channel client stores its session as a lazily-created attribute
(``self._session: Any = None``, built in ``connect()``). A test assigns a
:class:`FakeWireSession` onto that attribute and the client never creates a real
one::

    client = WeixinClient(token="t", base_url="https://example.invalid")
    wire = FakeWireSession()
    wire.route("POST", "sendmsg", {"errcode": 0})
    client._session = wire            # no monkeypatching of aiohttp internals

    await client.send_message("u1", "hi")
    sent = wire.requests[0]
    assert sent.json_body["base_info"]["app_id"]   # real payload, real headers

What this does and does NOT prove
---------------------------------
It proves our whole stack agrees with a PINNED response shape: if a fixture
says a field is a URL string, every layer above is verified against that.
It does NOT prove the vendor agrees -- only a live probe can establish the
shape in the first place. The intended workflow is therefore: probe once
against the real API (authorized), encode the observed shape here as a
fixture, and let the fixture guard every layer forever after. When a vendor
changes, one fixture changes and the whole stack is re-verified.
