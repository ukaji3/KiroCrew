"""The single ``aws`` CLI chokepoint for the cloud launcher.

Every AWS interaction in :mod:`kiro_crew.cloud` goes through :func:`run_aws`.
Nothing else in the package shells out to ``aws`` directly. This mirrors
``deploy_web/engine.py`` and gives the module the same testability: unit tests
monkeypatch this one function.

Credentials are resolved by the ``aws`` CLI's own provider chain — KiroCrew
passes only ``--profile <name>`` (and never a raw key). The argv is always a
fixed list (no shell), and the invocation is routed through the OS-level sandbox
(:func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.wrap_argv`, ``mode="standard"``) exactly like the
deploy-web subprocess, because the ``aws`` CLI must read ``~/.aws`` to resolve
credentials.
