    Choice text is LLM-authored, so it can carry (or be talked into carrying)
    Slack's own entity syntax. ``<!channel>``, ``<!here>`` and ``<@U…>`` are
    interpreted when they land in a ``mrkdwn`` field, so an OPTIONS tag reading
    ``[OPTIONS: <!channel> | Skip]`` would notify an entire channel the moment
    the summary is rendered -- on backfill, on submit, or on expiry.

    A message's top-level ``text`` argument is the SAME kind of sink: Slack parses
    entities there too, and it is what notifications and block-less clients show.
    So a caller handing choice text to ``post_message`` / ``post_blocks`` /
    ``update_message`` as the fallback text has to escape it as well -- escaping
    only the blocks leaves the notification path wide open. Public for that
    reason: more than one module needs it, and a second copy would drift.

    Slack's documented escaping, and ``&`` MUST go first: doing it after ``<``
    would re-escape the ampersands the earlier substitutions just introduced and
    show ``&amp;lt;`` on screen.

    Deliberately NOT folded into ``_redact_choices``, even though every mrkdwn
    caller goes through it. Its output also feeds the ``plain_text`` checkbox
    label -- which Slack does not interpret, so escaping there would display a
    literal ``&lt;`` -- and the button ``value`` that is echoed back into the
    session on submit, where an escaped entity would change the answer the user
    actually picked. Escaping belongs at the Slack-facing sink only, never on the

    The reason is not style. This function strips ANSI escapes and self-truncates

    a credential the escapes had split, and convert-then-redact lets the

    hold the only ordering that closes both.

    ``in_code`` says the text BEGINS inside a ``` fenced block. It exists for
    callers that convert in blocks: fence state is per-call, so a block starting

    """Render arbitrary text into postable Slack messages, redacting safely.

    This is the ONLY supported way to put text on Slack. It exists because the
    two obvious orderings of redact-vs-convert are each unsafe on their own, so
    a call site that picks one is exposed to whichever hazard it did not pick:

    - **redact then convert** — ``to_slack_mrkdwn`` calls :func:`strip_ansi`,
      and that strip *reassembles* a credential the escapes had broken up. A key
      written as ``AKIA<esc>IOSF…`` does not match the credential regex on the
      way in and arrives at Slack whole.
    - **convert then redact** — ``to_slack_mrkdwn`` self-truncates at
      ``SLACK_MAX_TEXT`` before converting, so it can cut a credential in half
      before the regex ever runs, leaving an unmatchable prefix on the wire (and
      silently dropping everything past 39,000 characters).

    The pipeline that holds is therefore::

        strip_ansi -> redact -> pre-split -> convert -> redact -> split

    Normalising first means the first redaction sees the credential whole while
    the text is still one piece. Pre-splitting below ``SLACK_MAX_TEXT`` means
    conversion never reaches its own truncation, so neither the tail nor a
    secret is cut there; blocks are halved against the limit so a conversion
    that *grows* text (table and mermaid rewriting) still cannot reach it.
    Redaction runs a second time on each converted block because conversion can
    still reorder or drop characters (inline markup, link rewriting) in ways
    that reveal a secret only afterwards — redacting on both sides of the
    transform is what makes the guarantee independent of what conversion does to
    the bytes.

    When — and only when — the pre-split produces more than one block, tables are
    left as raw markdown. ``_convert_tables`` keys a table's labels off the first
    ``|`` row it sees, so a block beginning part-way through a table adopts a
    DATA row as its header: that row's values are then only emitted as labels
    (and vanish entirely if no rows follow, because ``_flush_table`` returns
    early on an empty body). Raw pipes read worse on mobile, which is why this is
    not the default — but a message that never splits keeps the nicer rendering,
    and one that does keeps all of its rows.

    Args:
        text: Raw text to render. ``None``-ish and blank input yields ``[]``.
        limit: Per-message character ceiling, ``prefix`` included. Callers with a
            tighter budget than Slack's (cron uses 3,000) pass their own.
        prefix: Prepended to every returned part and charged against ``limit``,
            so a decorated part cannot overflow. Splitting first and decorating
            afterwards is what made the backfill's icon overflow the limit.
        header: A caption for the FIRST part only -- ``"⏰ *Cron: name*"`` and
            friends. Redacted but NOT converted, because these captions are
            already Slack mrkdwn and ``to_slack_mrkdwn`` would re-interpret their
            ``*bold*``. Skipping conversion is exactly why a caption needs its own
            redaction pass, and why doing it HERE rather than at each call site
            matters: captions are usually built from LLM-authored data (a cron's
            name comes from the ``cron_add`` tool), so a hand-rolled
            ``header + parts[0]`` has to remember to redact every single time --
            the same per-site-memory failure this function removes for bodies. One
            site had already forgotten.
        redactor: Text-to-text redactor. Defaults to the platform-context shim
            :func:`kiro_crew.platform.context.redact_via_context`, which is
            fail-closed and honours a host's own credential policy. Injectable so
            tests can assert ordering without composing a platform context.

    Returns:
        Ready-to-post strings, each already prefixed and within ``limit``.
        Empty when there is nothing to say, so callers can post unconditionally --
        EXCEPT when a ``header`` was given, which always yields at least the
