"""Mid-turn queue receipts — the single collapsing "⏳ Queued (N): …" bubble.

A message that arrives while a turn is running is either folded into that turn
as a steer or queued for after it. Queued messages get ONE receipt bubble that
is edited in place as the burst grows, then flipped to a durable record when the
turn drains it ("▶️ Now answering") or cancelled ("🛑 Cancelled"). Two channels
grew the same subsystem independently -- Telegram and Discord, ~560 duplicated
lines -- and this module is the half of it that is genuinely channel-neutral.

What lives here and what does NOT:

* HERE -- the receipt registry, its lock, and the three lifecycle transitions
  (create/grow, flip-to-answering, finalize-cancelled). These are pure
  bookkeeping over an opaque message id, and every line of them was identical
  across the two channels apart from the address type and the send call.
* NOT here -- ``_handle_busy`` and ``_drain_queue``. They re-enter the channel's
  own ``handle_message`` (whose signature differs per channel: route/chat_id/
  thread vs user_id/channel_id/thread_id) and they own the ``_active_renderers``
  registry. Sharing them would need a ``run_turn`` callback that buys nothing
  and couples this module to turn execution.

Channels reach the transitions through :class:`ReceiptSurface`, whose address is
bound at CONSTRUCTION -- so nothing below ever sees a ``chat_id``, a ``thread``
or a ``channel_id``, which is what let the five address-shaped divergences
between the two copies collapse to zero.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> messaging`` (never the reverse), matching
``messaging/dispatch.py``.
