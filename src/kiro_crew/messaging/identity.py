"""Per-turn session-identity publication — the single shared writer.

Every surface that runs an agent turn (the dashboard, native Slack, and each
channel ``transport_dispatch``) must publish the ``session_pid_<pid>.txt``
mapping so the gateway's ancestor PID-walk can resolve the caller's
``X-Session-Key`` for session-keyed managed MCP tools (``learn_add``, cron
management, and every other such handler). When a surface omits it the header
is empty and those tools reject the call with HTTP 400 ``missing
X-Session-Key``.

The obligation lives here — in one function every turn-running surface calls —
rather than as a copy-pasted, per-surface opt-in block: centralizing means a new
channel gets identity publication by calling one function, and any change to the
publish contract happens in exactly one place.
