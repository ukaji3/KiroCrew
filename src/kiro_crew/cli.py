    process via :func:`sys.exit` — with the jailed child's exit code on a
    successful re-exec, or ``2`` when ``agent.jail=on`` could not be satisfied.

    Fail-closed discipline (``mode == "on"`` means the operator DEMANDED
    isolation, so anything short of a real re-exec must refuse to run un-jailed):

    * Already inside the jail (``KIROCREW_JAILED`` marker set by a prior re-exec)

      ("already jailed"), and the on-mode floor would deadlock the child.
    * ``off`` (``--no-jail`` or ``KIROCREW_NO_JAIL`` truthy) → early return, no
      probe, run in-process.
    * ``available()`` is the backend-presence probe.  When it returns ``False``
      cleanly (the public Default) the gate is a NO-OP even under ``mode == "on"``
      — exactly as the ``agent.jail`` help text promises, and we never build the
      re-exec argv.  A :class:`PlatformCompositionError` always propagates.  A
      *transient* probe error degrades to "no backend" under ``auto`` but FAILS
      CLOSED under ``on`` (``exit 2``): an on-mode host must not run un-jailed
      just because the presence probe was flaky (availability unknown ≠ absent).
    * With a backend present + ``mode != "off"``, a single fail-closed floor
      governs the re-exec: under ``on`` anything other than a real re-exec (a
      ``None`` return OR a swallowed backend error, both leaving ``rc is None``)
      refuses to run un-jailed.  One check, so the error path and the
      ``None``-return path cannot diverge.

    The mode is re-normalized here (``_normalize_jail``) so a context whose

def _install_child_watcher() -> None:
    """Install a non-thread-per-child asyncio child watcher (Linux: pidfd; macOS: SIGCHLD).

    CPython 3.10's default ThreadedChildWatcher spawns a daemon thread per
    subprocess that blocks on os.waitpid(pid, 0).  When many children die
    simultaneously the resulting GIL contention starves the event-loop thread
    for tens of seconds.  PidfdChildWatcher uses a single epoll fd (no extra
    threads) and is immune to this.  On macOS (no pidfd syscall) we install
    SafeChildWatcher instead -- a single SIGCHLD handler, also free of the
    thread-per-child storm (the _node_version_manager_bins lru_cache only
    shrank the surface; the reaper storm itself remained on the default
    watcher).

    Python 3.14: ``set_child_watcher`` / ``PidfdChildWatcher`` /
    ``SafeChildWatcher`` are deprecated in CPython 3.12 and REMOVED in 3.14 --
    the event loop reaps children directly.  The whole function is therefore a
    no-op there, short-circuited by the ``hasattr`` guard below; without it the
    unguarded Linux pidfd branch raised ``AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has
    no attribute 'set_child_watcher'`` and killed ``kirocrew gateway`` on
    startup, before the port was ever bound.  The mitigation is not lost: 3.14
    reaps with a single non-thread reaper, so the thread-per-child storm this
    function exists to prevent cannot occur.
    ``set_child_watcher`` on a pre-run policy is attached to the loop by
    ``asyncio.run`` -> ``set_event_loop`` (main thread), so installing before
    ``asyncio.run`` here is correct on 3.10 for both watchers.

    Main-thread dependency (macOS): unlike the default ThreadedChildWatcher
    (whose ``is_active()`` is hard-coded True and whose ``attach_loop`` is a
    no-op), SafeChildWatcher attaches a SIGCHLD handler via
    ``loop.add_signal_handler`` -- which only runs when ``set_event_loop`` is
    called on the MAIN thread, and is what makes ``is_active()`` True.  The
    ``kirocrew gateway`` path satisfies this (``asyncio.run`` on the main thread
    before any subprocess spawns).  If a future caller ever drives this loop
    from a non-main thread, ``is_active()`` stays False and the FIRST
    ``create_subprocess_exec`` raises ``RuntimeError`` -- re-evaluate the install
    point then.

    Kernel probe (Linux): on 3.10 ``PidfdChildWatcher()`` does NOT validate
    kernel support -- ``__init__`` only sets ``_loop``/``_callbacks``; the
    ``pidfd_open`` syscall is first issued lazily inside ``add_child_handler``.
    So a bare ``PidfdChildWatcher()`` succeeds on a < 5.3 kernel, gets
    installed, and then the FIRST ``create_subprocess_exec`` raises
    ``OSError(ENOSYS)`` -- breaking all subprocess management instead of falling
    back.  Probe ``os.pidfd_open`` explicitly here and only install
    PidfdChildWatcher when the syscall works.

    Pidfd-unavailable (Linux): the probe raises ``OSError`` on a < 5.3 kernel,
    and ``AttributeError`` when the interpreter's build omits the
    ``os.pidfd_open`` wrapper entirely -- observed on a uv-managed / Clang-built
    CPython 3.12 aarch64 venv even though the running kernel supports pidfd.
    In BOTH cases we must NOT install PidfdChildWatcher (it would ENOSYS on the
    first spawn), but we must ALSO NOT fall back to the default
    ThreadedChildWatcher -- its thread-per-child ``os.waitpid`` reaper storm is
    the exact wedge this function exists to prevent (8 ``_do_waitpid`` threads
    starving the loop past the watchdog's ``exit_after``, killing the gateway
    seconds after startup under a throttling model backend). Instead
    fall through to the SIGCHLD-based SafeChildWatcher, the same watcher the
    macOS path uses.
