"""Cron service for scheduling agent tasks.

Jobs are stored in the config directory (``~/.kiro/crew/crons.json`` by default,
overridden by ``KIROCREW_HOME``) and executed by a background
asyncio timer.  Each job fires a callback (typically posting to Slack via ACP).

Cross-process safety: the CLI and gateway run as separate processes sharing
the same ``crons.json``.  All read-modify-write cycles use advisory file
locking (fcntl), and a content-digest ``_sync()`` detects external file changes
before every mutation.  Job execution releases the lock so long-running jobs
don't block the CLI.

Jobs are created via MCP tools (``cron_add``) or the CLI (``kirocrew cron add``).

Supports three schedule types:
- ``every`` — recurring interval (min 60s)
- ``at`` — one-shot at a unix timestamp
- ``cron`` — standard cron expression (min hour dom month dow)

# ── Loop-safety guard ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The store lock (``CronService._file_lock``) must NEVER be acquired on a thread
# that has a running asyncio event loop: the bounded ``time.sleep`` spin would
# park that loop under contention. The invariant is upheld structurally —
# loop-resident callers use the ``*_async`` mutators (which ``asyncio.to_thread``
# the lock+save) and the synchronous ``CronSDK`` facade offloads to a worker
# thread when a loop is running — but conventions drift as new writers are
# added. ``_file_lock`` therefore MACHINE-ENFORCES the rule: on entry it detects
# a running loop on the current thread and, when strict mode is enabled, RAISES
# so a regression is caught in CI rather than silently re-freezing the loop.
#
# Gating mirrors the repo's other strict rails (e.g. KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_
# PERSIST): OFF by default it degrades to a throttled warning (so no production
# path is broken by an unforeseen legitimate on-loop caller, and existing tests
# that seed jobs via the sync mutators from an async body keep passing); the CI
# loop-safety regression test flips it ON to prove the guard fires and that the
# sanctioned async / offloaded-sync paths do NOT trip it. Operators can export
# KIROCREW_STRICT_LOOP_SAFETY=1 to escalate the warning to a hard failure fleet-
# wide.

          persisted pause flags, not the removal intent) cannot let it fire.

        computed AFTER the swap so the intersection sees the post-swap job

        parks the calling thread in an uninterruptible kernel wait for as long

        (:meth:`add_job`, :meth:`update_job`, :meth:`remove_job`,
        :meth:`enable_job`, …) takes this lock directly on the gateway's
        asyncio event loop. A single slow holder (a large atomic save on
        network storage, the CLI process, or the off-loop batch-remove worker)
        would therefore freeze the ENTIRE event loop — every unrelated session,
        timer, and reaper — until it released.

        The non-blocking spin polls with a short ``time.sleep`` between
        attempts (releasing the GIL so worker threads make progress) and raises
        :class:`CronStoreBusy` (a :class:`TimeoutError` subclass) after
        ``timeout`` rather than blocking indefinitely. flock on separate open
        descriptions mutually excludes within a single process too, so this
        still serializes the loop-side mutators against the ``asyncio.to_thread``
        batch-remove and mutator workers.

        The loop-resident mutator boundaries do NOT call this directly on the
        event loop — they use the ``*_async`` mutator variants (``add_job_async``

        raised :class:`CronStoreBusy` into a clean retryable error. The bounded
        sync path here still serves the CLI/MCP server processes (no event loop
        to park) and remains a strict improvement over the old unbounded flock.

        :meth:`_guard_off_event_loop` raises :class:`CronLoopSafetyError` (strict
        mode) or warns (default) if this is entered on a thread with a running
        asyncio loop — so a future writer that calls a sync mutator on the loop
        is caught rather than silently re-freezing it.

        EXHAUSTIVE AUDIT — every ``_sync()`` caller and raw store-``read``
        site in this module, classified by whether it can run on the gateway
        event loop. INVARIANT: **no ``_sync()`` / whole-file ``read_bytes()`` +
        hash ever runs on the loop.** All blocking store I/O is either in a
        worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) or in a loop-less process
        (CLI / MCP). Enforced mechanically by
        ``test_cron_locking_regression.py::TestReadPathsLocked`` (on-loop reads
        AND the timer tick must not touch the store on the loop).

        ``_sync()`` callers
          • _persist_add_locked / _update_job_locked_kw / _remove_job_locked /
            _remove_jobs_locked / _enable_job_locked / _ack_job_locked /
            _unack_job_locked  → OFF-LOOP: reached from the loop only via their
            ``*_async`` wrappers, which ``await asyncio.to_thread(...)``; also
            called directly by loop-less CLI/MCP/app-SDK processes.
          • _synced_snapshot  → OFF-LOOP (worker): the body of
            list_jobs_async / get_job_async / run_job's offloaded refresh.
          • _tick_scan_locked  → OFF-LOOP (worker): the timer tick's
            (``_on_timer``) offloaded lock+sync+drain+snapshot transaction.
          • _merge_job_result  → OFF-LOOP on the gateway (``_run_job_isolated``
            calls it via ``asyncio.to_thread``); loop-less CLI/MCP may call it
            directly.
          • run_job  → now OFF-LOOP: its former on-loop ``_sync()`` moved into
            the ``_synced_snapshot`` offload; the ``_executing`` claim stays on
            the loop and does NO store I/O.

        Raw store ``read_bytes()`` sites
          • _record_fingerprint (post-load/save) / _sync / _load  → all reached
            only through the OFF-LOOP ``_sync()`` callers above (or a loop-less
            process). None on the loop.
          • initial ``_load()`` (construction / ``start()``)  → the plain
            constructor loads INLINE (loop-less CLI/MCP/apps-SDK/tests only —
            no loop to park). Loop contexts (the gateway) build via the async
            factory ``CronService.create()``, which sets
            ``_defer_initial_load=True`` and runs ``_load()`` via
            ``asyncio.to_thread``; ``start()`` likewise offloads its ``_load()``.
            ``_running`` is False during both, so neither arms a timer off-loop.
            OFF-LOOP on the gateway.

        Cache-only (NO store I/O at all — never lock, read, or hash)
          • list_jobs / get_job  → on-loop hot paths; return the atomically-
            swapped in-memory snapshot.
          • _reaper_loop's ``jobs_by_id`` snapshot  → on-loop; cache-only,
            same atomic-reference-swap rationale as list_jobs.

        WRITE-PATH AUDIT — every ``_save()`` call site and every structural

        is reached from the gateway event loop ONLY via ``asyncio.to_thread``
        (or runs in a genuinely loop-less CLI/MCP process). No bare on-loop
