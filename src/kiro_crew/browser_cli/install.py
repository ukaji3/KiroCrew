"""Detection, installation, and the capability gate for ``@playwright/cli``.

The CLI has no capability gating of its own — every command is always available
to whoever can run the binary — so the capability cannot be narrowed after the
fact. **Presence of ``playwright-cli`` is therefore consent**, whichever tool
installed it, and :func:`available` is the whole gate. This module deliberately
holds no toggle, flag, or consent file: a second gate would be a lie, because a
binary on PATH is reachable from any shell turn regardless of what a flag says.

Installation is global (``npm install -g``) rather than ``npx``. ``npx``
re-resolves the package through the registry on every invocation, so an expired
registry token would take browsing down at use time; a global binary resolves
once, at install time, where a failure is visible to the operator.

Node is located through :func:`kiro_crew.env.find_node_tool` rather than bare
``shutil.which``: the gateway can run with a PATH that omits the version-manager
shim directory a global npm install writes into, so a plain PATH lookup misses
a binary that is genuinely present.

Every function here blocks (subprocess, filesystem), so a caller on the event
loop offloads it.

    The gateway's own PATH is not sufficient: a global ``npm install -g`` lands
    in a version-manager-owned bin directory that the gateway process may never
    have had on PATH, so a child that inherits it unchanged cannot find the
    binary that was just installed.

    Two layers, node bins outermost so they win:

    1. :func:`node_augmented_path` prepends the Node bin dirs, so ``npm``/``node``
       resolve to the managed toolchain.
    2. :func:`augmented_path` (the inner layer) contributes the broad non-login
       PATH -- ``~/.local/bin``, ``/opt/homebrew/bin``, the mise shims -- because
       the mise-managed per-version ``npm`` is itself a wrapper script that runs
       ``mise reshim`` after a global install. That hook needs the ``mise``
       binary itself on PATH, and mise installs to ``~/.local/bin`` (or
       Homebrew's bin), NOT to any Node bin dir. A GUI- or daemon-launched
       gateway inherits a minimal PATH lacking those dirs, so without this layer
       the wrapper dies ``mise: command not found`` and, under its
       ``set -euo pipefail``, fails the whole ``npm install -g`` with rc 127.

    This also aligns the exec env with discovery: :func:`cli_path` already
    searches over ``node_augmented_path(augmented_path(PATH))``, so the child's
    PATH now matches the path the binary was resolved on.

    is a later, optional choice the old Browser Mode panel exposed as an engine
    selector and which would otherwise have no surface at all.

    *engine* is validated against :data:`BROWSER_ENGINES` before it can reach
    argv. That check is what keeps this spawn benign (fixed argv, no free input)
    rather than an agent-influenced one -- see ``test_spawn_audit``.
