"""OAuth-style refresh tokens for the KiroCrew dashboard.

Adds a paired refresh cookie alongside the existing access cookie
(``mc_token_<port>``) so users do not need to re-mint via the
``kirocrew token`` URL every ~20 hours.

Design (full spec in ``docs/system-specs/features/dashboard-token-auth.md``):

- Refresh cookie ``mc_refresh_<port>`` is path-restricted to
  ``/api/auth/refresh`` — narrower attack surface than the access cookie.
- Lifetime up to 30 days (``MAX_REFRESH_TTL_SECS``), HMAC-signed with the
  same persistent ``token_signing.key`` secret as the access cookie.
- Rotation-on-use: each ``/api/auth/refresh`` call mints a fresh pair and
  marks the prior ``jti`` consumed.
- Reuse detection (RFC 6819 §5.2.2.3): a consumed ``jti`` presented again
  outside the multi-tab grace window auto-revokes the entire chain.
- 60-second same-IP grace window absorbs benign multi-tab races.
- Persistence: ``~/.kiro/crew/refresh_chains.json`` (mode ``0600``).

# same-IP within the window, resolved to the live head instead of tripping
# chain revocation) and was flagged by the Design + Long-Term Impact reviewers.
# The maintainer chose the STRONGER posture: only the chain head is accepted, so
# any OLDER rotated jti replayed within the window is treated as token reuse and

    Persists consumed-``jti`` and revoked-``chain_id`` records to disk so

    The multi-tab grace state (``_grace_replacements``) is deliberately
    IN-MEMORY only — it is never serialized by ``_persist()``/``_load()``.
    A gateway restart that lands inside a 60s grace window therefore drops the
    grace entry while ``consumed_jtis`` survives, so a lagging tab's in-flight
    refresh could still hit reuse-detection. This is a rare, self-correcting
