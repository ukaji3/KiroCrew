"""Publish (and unpublish) the dashboard on this machine's tailnet.

The write half of tailnet access. Until this module existed, Kiro Crew never ran
``tailscale serve`` anywhere: the config switch made the gateway *trust* the
tailnet origin, but actually putting the dashboard on the tailnet was a command
the operator had to know and type. So the promised one-command experience was
really two commands, one of them undocumented in the UI, and skipping it produced
a working-looking switch that changed nothing observable.

Deliberately a **separate module from** :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.tailnet`, whose
documented contract is the opposite of what a write path needs:

* ``tailnet`` is read-only enrichment and **swallows every failure** — a missing
  binary, a stopped daemon and a timeout all collapse to ``None``, because its
  caller only wants "a name or nothing" and must not be able to break startup.
* Here a failure is the **entire point of the call**. ``tailscale serve`` refuses
  for reasons the operator can act on and cannot guess — most often because
  changing serve config needs root or an ``--operator`` grant — so collapsing
  those to a bare "failed" would reproduce the unexplained-refusal problem this
  feature exists to remove.

Two consequences of never having seen this daemon's real output on a live tailnet
(this repo's dev host has no Tailscale) shape the code, and both are deliberate
rather than provisional:

**The daemon's own stderr is always passed through verbatim.** ``code`` is a
best-effort classification for the UI to branch on; ``detail`` carries what
Tailscale actually said. If the classification is wrong or the phrasing changes
upstream, the operator still sees the real reason instead of our guess at it.

**Published-state detection does not depend on the JSON schema.** Rather than
reading key paths from ``tailscale serve status --json`` that are unverified here,
:func:`serve_state` searches the parsed document for a proxy target naming our own
port. That is robust to a schema this code has never observed, and an
unrecognisable document reports ``unknown`` rather than ``not published`` — the
difference matters, because "not published" invites a publish the node may not
need while ``unknown`` says plainly that we could not tell.

#: Withdrawal passes it **explicitly**, and that is load-bearing rather than
#: cosmetic. Upstream's ``unsetServe`` treats an absent ``--set-path`` as "every
#: mount under this port": it collects all of them and removes them all — so a
#: port-wide ``off`` deletes sibling handlers an operator added by hand. With the
#: mount named, upstream removes exactly that one. It also avoids a second
#: hazard: the multi-mount path prompts interactively
#: (``prompt.YesNo("Are you sure you want to delete N handlers…")``) unless

    * ``-1`` — no binary at any vetted path. "Tailscale is not installed here."

    * ``-3`` — the binary exists but could not be launched (``OSError``), with the

    ``--set-path`` as "every mount under this port" — it collects all handlers and
    deletes them — so a port-wide ``off`` destroys sibling handlers an operator
    added by hand, and prompts interactively when there is more than one (which a
