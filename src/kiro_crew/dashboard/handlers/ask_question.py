"""Agent-question HTTP API — render a question card and block for the answer.

Two endpoints form one blocking round-trip:

``POST /api/ask-question``
    Called by the ``ask_question`` MCP tool. Validates the question payload,
    broadcasts a ``question_card`` to the owning slot's dashboard clients, and
    holds the request open until the user answers (or the window elapses).

``POST /api/ask-question/{ask_id}/answer``
    Called by the dashboard when the user submits (or dismisses) the card.
    Resolves the blocked request above.

This mirrors the tool-approval round-trip in
:meth:`kiro_crew.dashboard.state.DashboardState.request_approval` — the
difference is that the resolution value is the user's answer map rather than an
allow/deny boolean, and the card is addressed to a single slot.
