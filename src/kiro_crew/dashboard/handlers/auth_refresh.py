"""Auth refresh endpoints: ``GET /api/auth/me`` and ``POST /api/auth/refresh``.

Spec: ``docs/system-specs/features/dashboard-token-auth.md``.

Both endpoints handle their own auth (the standard ``token_auth_middleware``
exempts ``/api/auth/refresh`` so an expired access cookie does not block
the refresh path). ``/api/auth/me`` requires a valid access cookie and is
gated by the standard middleware.

# spoofed-XFF pump) slowly leaks memory. We sweep stale/empty buckets at most
# once per window; that reclaim path is the sole way live buckets leave the
# map. A hard cap (``_REFRESH_RATE_MAX_BUCKETS``) then fails CLOSED: once the
# map is full, previously-unseen source IPs are rate-limited outright rather
# than admitted by evicting an existing bucket. We deliberately do NOT evict a
# live bucket to make room — evicting the "least-recently-active" victim was
# abusable (see ``_rate_limited``): a saturated attacker never appends a
# timestamp on denied calls, so their bucket freezes at exhaustion time and
# becomes the eviction target under an XFF/botnet pump, letting them drop their
# own exhausted bucket and re-mint a fresh full allowance. Fail-closed removes
# that reset path entirely. To avoid a sustained-flood / trusted-XFF
# availability gap (a pinned-at-capacity map denying legitimate new IPs while
# full of reclaimable stale buckets), the sweep is invoked UNCONDITIONALLY
