    The bounded half (block label -> size, aggregated) is what belongs on a

    Rows written before this field existed simply carry no ``ctx_blocks`` and

    inventing zeros for history.

    ``estimated_other_chars`` is the remainder of the model's context that
    KiroCrew did NOT inject — kiro-cli's own base prompt, its tool catalogue and
    its steering files. It is an ESTIMATE and labelled as one everywhere it is
    surfaced: the provider reports occupancy in tokens while every KiroCrew

    Answers "what did the last *days* cost, compared with the *days* before it,

    it is the unit here, with ``context_used`` as the second real signal.

    Three deliberate shapes:

    * **Every** model is reported, never a top-N slice. A truncated list hides a
      model switch, which on real data moved the bill far more than usage volume
      did, and a single-user store is small enough to render complete.
    * ``channel`` is derived from the session key, NOT read from the row's
      ``surface`` field. Historical rows can carry a wrong but non-empty value
      such as ``dashboard`` for a Telegram turn, and the token-row schema has no
      version or writer marker that distinguishes them from trustworthy rows.
      The key therefore remains authoritative until the store gains such a
      boundary; a surface-first fallback would silently misattribute history.
    * Context bands are absolute token counts rather than occupancy ratios:
      spend tracks how many tokens get re-sent, and window sizes differ per
      model, so a ratio would average incomparable populations.
