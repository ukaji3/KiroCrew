"""Per-channel session filing — route channel conversations into a folder.

Each messaging channel carries an optional ``session_folder`` config value
(``discord.session_folder``, ``slack.session_folder``, …). Empty — the default —
means the feature is off and a channel conversation stays unfiled, exactly as
before. Any other value is the name of the sidebar folder that channel's
sessions are filed into as they are surfaced by
:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.channel_slots`.

Design notes:

* **Name is the identity.** The folder is matched by its configured NAME, not
  by a stored id, so the same config always lands in the same folder and the
  user can rename the setting to point at a different one. A folder this module
  creates is stamped with ``channel: "<namespace>"``, which is what makes the
  sidebar draw the channel's brand mark on it instead of a generic folder glyph.
* **Adopt before create.** An existing folder with the configured name is
  reused rather than duplicated — including one the user made by hand, so
  "file Discord sessions in my existing Chats folder" works.
* **Creation happens when the setting is SAVED, never while surfacing.** The
  config endpoints call :func:`ensure_channel_folder` (a user-initiated write,
  in a handler that already writes config.json synchronously), and the
  reconciler only ever calls :func:`lookup_channel_folder`, which reads. Keeping
  the reconcile path write-free is deliberate: it is reached from the 30s timer
  AND from ``surface_dispatcher_session`` on every inbound channel message, so a
  write there both blocks the event loop on ``fsync`` and races a second pass.
  A configured folder that does not exist (config.json hand-edited, or the user
  deleted the folder) leaves conversations unfiled until the next settings save
  recreates it — the pre-feature behaviour, not a broken state.
* **Filing happens once, at surface time.** Only a conversation that does not
  already have a folder is filed, and only the first time its slot is created —
  a conversation with slot-side history metadata has been surfaced before, so
  its current placement (top level included) is the user's, not the setting's.
  A session the user later moves elsewhere is never re-filed, so the setting
  cannot fight a manual move, across restarts either.

    marks a session as already filed) one that no later save would correct.

    A folder the user hid is returned as normal. No unhide write is needed:
