"""Instances API handlers — owner-only control plane for multi-instance mgmt.

Backs the ``/api/instances/*`` routes. Every route:

* is **gated behind ``instances.enabled``** (default off) — returns 403 when
  the feature is disabled, so toggling requires an explicit opt-in;
* is **owner-only and never reachable via the Slack path** — a request whose
  ``X-Session-Key`` indicates a Slack origin is rejected, so chat-sharing a hub
  can never pivot into SSH control;
* emits a **SEL audit event** on both reads and writes (security observability
  for an SSH-pivoting control plane).

Connect responds with the minted dashboard **token** so the browser can set the
embedded iframe's first-party cookie; that response is the *only* place a token
crosses this boundary, it is never logged, and it never appears in list/status.
