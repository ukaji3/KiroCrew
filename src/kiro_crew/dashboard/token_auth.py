    Enables PER-SESSION logout (CWE-613). The access cookie is a self-contained
    HMAC-signed token, so clearing it client-side (``Set-Cookie max_age=0``)
    does NOT stop a saved copy being replayed until its ``session_exp`` (up to
    20h). ``POST /api/auth/logout`` records the caller's access-cookie ``nonce``
    here; :func:`validate_token` (cookie path) then rejects any token whose
    nonce is listed — killing exactly that one session WITHOUT bumping the
    global generation counter (``revoke_all_sessions``), which would log out
    every other user too.

    Persisted to disk (mode ``0600``) so a revoked cookie stays dead across a
    gateway restart — unlike the in-memory link-nonce set in
    :class:`TokenStateManager`, which is restart-cleared and intentionally NOT
    consulted for cookies. Each entry stores the token's own ``session_exp`` as
    an eviction floor: once that passes, the expiry check rejects the token
    anyway, so the record is dropped and the file cannot grow without bound.

# the sha256 of every stored token entry with hmac.compare_digest and refuses
# with 401 when none match, including when no token exists at all, so the
# endpoint is closed by default on a fresh install). It is a deliberate exposure
# decision: a valid token authorizes a real agent turn with full tool access, so
# the handler also rate-limits repeated failures per source
# (webhooks.auth_throttle) and records every 401 in the run history.
#
# For that entry the method scope is load-bearing, not tidiness. The literal
# string ``agent`` also matches the ``{hook_id}`` wildcard of the dashboard's own
# hook CRUD routes — PUT and DELETE ``/api/hooks/{hook_id}`` — whose handler
# (api_hook_detail) authenticates via the dashboard token alone. Unscoped, both
# reach it with no credential of any kind.

# ``POST /api/messaging/teams`` is the Microsoft Teams inbound webhook: Bot
# Framework (Microsoft's servers, no dashboard cookie) posts activities there and

# Naming those two sub-namespaces is load-bearing. Matching any sub-path (the

# `/apps/{name}/api/{path:.*}`), and no bare `/apps/{name}/ui` or
# `/apps/{name}/api` route exists. An earlier `(?:/|$)` therefore excluded two

# position as the router's `detail`/`migrate` verbs, an app named literally
# "api" or "ui" got a 404 on /apps/detail/api. Requiring the slash costs no
