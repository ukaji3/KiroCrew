# Webex dispatch, workflow/cron injection) may still call synchronously from the
# gateway event loop. An UNBOUNDED blocking acquire there would let one wedged
# writer in another process freeze the whole gateway indefinitely, and simply
# *proceeding* after a timeout would write WITHOUT the cross-process lock — a
# stale rewrite in the holder can then clobber that write (silent transcript
# loss). So we do neither: we poll ``try_acquire_lock`` up to a bounded deadline
# and, on timeout, RAISE ``HistoryLockTimeout`` (fail the mutation) instead of
# writing unlocked. The critical sections under the lock are all short (append a
# line / rewrite one metadata line / rotate) so a real contention window clears
# in milliseconds; a timeout means a genuinely wedged holder.
#
# The acquire strategy is chosen by execution context. Off the event loop
# (worker threads, subagents, crons, CLI) a caller can afford to poll patiently
# up to ``_FLOCK_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_S``. ON a running asyncio loop we must NEVER
# block or sleep — even a sub-second poll stalls every chat/heartbeat/websocket
# on the gateway's sole event loop — so the loop path makes exactly ONE
# non-blocking acquire attempt and fails fast on contention. Callers on the loop
# should offload persistence via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (see the transport
# dispatchers' ``_persist_turn``) or via :func:`append_off_loop` (see the
# dashboard ``inject_cron_result_to_dashboard`` / ``inject_workflow_result``

    The offload invariant (see the ``_locked`` contract and
    ``docs/system-specs/modules/history.md``) is that NO session-JSONL mutator
    runs on the gateway event loop: on-loop callers route through
    ``append_off_loop`` / ``append_if_absent_off_loop`` / ``update_metadata_off_loop``
    / ``save_slot_off_loop`` (or ``asyncio.to_thread``), all of which dispatch
    the mutation to a worker thread so ``_locked`` runs OFF the loop and takes
    the patient acquire path. A raw on-loop mutator call works in every low-
    traffic test and use (the flock is uncontended) and only loses data under
    real concurrency — where the on-loop path makes a single non-blocking
    acquire, raises :class:`HistoryLockTimeout`, and the caller's best-effort
    ``try/except`` swallows it as silent transcript loss.

    Because that failure is invisible in CI, ``_locked`` fails LOUD instead:
    when strict enforcement is active (:func:`_on_loop_persist_strict` — on under
    ``KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST`` or ``KIROCREW_DEV_MODE``) any on-loop
    entry raises this error so an un-offloaded call-site fails tests rather than
    losing data in production. In production (strict off) the same on-loop entry
    is instead logged loudly (throttled) and proceeds via the single non-blocking
    safety-net acquire. Tests that deliberately exercise the low-level on-loop
    primitive wrap the call in :func:`allow_on_loop_persist`.

    built on :func:`transcript_sort_key` -- is then free to render the answer
    above the question that prompted it.

    Returning ``previous`` plus one microsecond when the clock has not advanced
    makes the order a property of the write sequence rather than of the clock's

    the previous row already claims to be, so it cannot push a row past one that

    the one way that decides an eviction policy. A search walks
    ``_SEARCH_SCAN_WINDOW`` sessions **in the same recency order every query**,
    so the working set is cyclic. Under LRU a cyclic scan larger than the cache
    evicts each entry exactly one step before its next read: the hit rate does
    not degrade, it collapses to zero, and it does so for the users with the
    most sessions — the ones the memo exists for. ``_folded_cache`` was sized
    ``max(cache_max, _SEARCH_SCAN_WINDOW)`` for precisely that reason.

    An entry *count* is the wrong bound to carry that guarantee, though: 500
    entries is 37 MB on one corpus and could be far more on another, because a
    session is read up to ``_SESSION_MAX_BYTES``. The bound here is therefore
    **bytes**, which is what actually has to fit in the gateway's RSS.

    A byte budget reintroduces the cliff, so eviction is replaced by
    **admission control**: when a new entry would exceed the budget it is simply
    not stored, and the entries already held are kept. For a cyclic scan that
    turns 0% into (whatever fraction fits)% — and because ``search_sessions``
    walks most-recent-first, the fraction that stays cached is the most recently
    active sessions, which is the half worth keeping. Existing entries are still
    replaced in place on a content change (same key, new value), so a session
    that is being written to never gets stuck on a stale value.

        release/close must never execute inline on the loop.

        Off the loop we run the cleanup inline. On the loop we dispatch it to

        retrieved" warning.

        :meth:`append` locks per ROW, so two callers each writing a

        assistant_B`` -- a transcript whose turns no longer pair up, and which no
        timestamp ordering can repair because every row's ``ts`` is correct.

        The hazard is specific to concurrent writers. A caller running ON the
        event loop could not hit it: ``save_conversation_turn`` never awaits
        between its two appends, so the single-threaded loop made the pair
        effectively atomic. It appears exactly when a caller does the right thing
        and moves the write OFF the loop, because two worker threads then run
        those pairs concurrently. So this is the companion any multi-append
        caller needs alongside the offload, not an optional extra.

        ``_locked`` is reentrant for the same key on the same thread, so the
        per-row locks inside ``append`` reuse the lock held here rather than
        deadlocking on it.

        Enter this OFF the event loop. It takes the same acquire path as
        ``append``, which fails fast with :class:`HistoryLockTimeout` on a

        never-consolidated retained messages as already processed.

        Detection uses two independent signals:

        1. **Generation change** (primary, when *generation* is supplied):
           any rotation between snapshot and write bumps the counter, so a
           mismatch resets ``last_consolidated`` to 0 regardless of how many
           messages the rotation retained. This closes the case a pure
           offset-vs-count heuristic misses — a rotation that keeps >= *offset*
           messages leaves ``offset <= msg_count`` true yet has still shifted
           every index.
        2. **Offset exceeds current count** (fallback, always): the file shrank
           below the captured offset (rotation truncated it). Retained if
           *generation* is unavailable (legacy callers) or as defense-in-depth.

        In either case ``last_consolidated`` is reset to 0 and the retained tail
        is reconsolidated rather than clamping the offset to EOF (which would
        silently mark post-rotation messages as already consolidated and drop
        them from memory/history extraction). When neither trips, the offset is
        applied as-is.

        distinguish from ``(0, "")`` (a session with no textual content): the
        former must not be cached.

        Reads the file via :meth:`_iter_message_texts` rather than going through
        :meth:`_read_messages`, for two reasons.

        Memory: that method memoizes the PARSED message dicts, and a search
        touches every session in the scan window, so routing the fold through it
        pins the whole corpus's parsed form in gateway RSS as a side effect of
        searching. On a 136 MB / 125-session corpus that is ~330 MB of parsed
        dicts versus ~37 MB for the folded strings this actually needs.

        Correctness: ``_msg_cache`` is filled by callers that do not hold this
        key's write lock, so an entry can be a pre-rewrite parse stored under a
        restored (unchanged) mtime. Folding from it would launder that staleness
        into the search cache, which the caller's lock cannot prevent. Reading
        the file makes the fold a function of the file alone.

        The caller holds ``_file_lock``, which orders this read against writers
        in THIS process. A writer in another process holds only the cross-process
        flock, so it can still interleave — but the caller stats BEFORE this read,
        so such a write leaves the cached mtime older than the file's and the next
        access re-folds. That case is self-healing, unlike the preserved-mtime
        rewrite the lock exists for.

        Separated from :meth:`_folded_content` so the memoization is observable:
        a caller (or a test) can count how often the expensive fold actually
        runs, independent of how many queries were served.
