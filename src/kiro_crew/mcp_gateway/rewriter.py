"""Rewrite kiro agent JSON so MCP servers route through the broker.

The rewriter reads ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` and writes modified copies into
the overlay directory (``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``). The host
filesystem remains untouched — the broker stubs in these specs are injected
into each kiro-cli session over ACP ``session/new``, which outranks the
same-named entry in the agent spec (see ``session_servers.py``).

Servers in :data:`UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS` are left unwrapped because they bind
to ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` and cannot be safely shared across sessions.

        overlay_dir: Usually ``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``. Created
            if missing. Cleared of stale files not in ``source_dir``.
        socket_path: Absolute path to the gateway unix socket.
        work_dir: Default cwd passed to the stub (and used in PoolKey
            hashing). Created if missing; gatewayd sets it as the backend
            process's ``current_dir``.
        sandbox_mode: Value from ``config.agent.sandbox`` — fed through
            so the stub's PoolKey matches KiroCrew's sandbox policy.
        approval_mode: Value from ``config.agent.approval_mode`` — same.
        poolable_servers: Server names from ``config.mcp_gateway.poolable_servers``.
            A stdio server's backend is SHARED across connections when its name
            is in this set OR its entry sets ``poolable: true``. Every stdio
            server gets a stub either way — the stub is the addressing layer, and
            this set only decides whether the backend behind it is shared.
            ``None`` is treated as an empty set.
        pooling_enabled: ``config.mcp_gateway.enabled``. When ``False`` no stub
            is marked shareable, so every connection gets its own backend while
            stubs stay in place — the state that lets MCP Apps work with pooling
            entirely off.

    Returns:
        A ``(results, target_env)`` tuple:

        * ``results``: mapping ``{agent_filename: wrapped_server_count}``.
          Agents with no MCP servers are omitted.
        * ``target_env``: mapping ``{KIROCREW_MCP_TARGET_<SERVER>: "cmd arg arg"}``
          suitable for ``GatewaySpec.mcp_target_env``. Gatewayd consults
          these when a stub registers, to find the real backend command
          to spawn for a new pool key.
