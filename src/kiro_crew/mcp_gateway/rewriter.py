"""Rewrite kiro agent JSON so MCP servers route through the broker.

The rewriter reads ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` and writes modified copies into
the overlay directory (``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``). The host
filesystem remains untouched — the broker stubs in these specs are injected
into each kiro-cli session over ACP ``session/new``, which outranks the
same-named entry in the agent spec (see ``session_servers.py``).

Servers in :data:`UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS` are left unwrapped because they bind
to ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` and cannot be safely shared across sessions.

The rewrite is fingerprint-cached: a content-signature snapshot of every input is
kept at ``<overlay_dir>/.rewrite-fingerprint``, and a boot whose inputs all
match serves the previous run's overlays (and its cached ``target_env``)
instead of re-parsing, re-resolving and re-writing everything. The prune
pass runs on both paths. Any doubt — torn file, missing output, unresolved
command — falls through to the full rewrite.

    Never modifies ``source_dir``. Idempotent — safe to call on every
    Kiro Crew startup. When no input changed since the last completed run
    (see :func:`_rewrite_inputs_fingerprint`) the rewrite loop is skipped and
    the cached ``(results, target_env)`` is returned; the stale-file prune
    still runs on that path.

    Args:
        source_dir: Usually ``~/.kiro/agents/``.
        overlay_dir: Usually ``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``. Created
            if missing. Cleared of stale files not in ``source_dir``.
        socket_path: Absolute path to the gateway unix socket.
        work_dir: Default cwd passed to the stub (and used in PoolKey
            hashing). Created if missing; gatewayd sets it as the backend
            process's ``current_dir``.
        sandbox_mode: Value from ``config.agent.sandbox`` — fed through
            so the stub's PoolKey matches KiroCrew's sandbox policy.
        approval_mode: Value from ``config.agent.approval_mode`` — same.
        stub_servers: Server names from ``config.mcp_gateway.stub_servers``.
            A stdio server gets a stub when its name is in this set — that list is
            the ONLY trigger. A per-agent-spec ``poolable: true`` is retired and
            deliberately ignored here: both real gates (the broker start gate and
            the session overlay) read the config list, so honouring the spec key
            produced a stub nothing pointed at. It is still stripped before the
            entry reaches kiro-cli, and still reported as ``entry_poolable`` for
            information only. An unstubbed server is left untouched for the
            session to launch itself, which is what keeps the default free of both
            a daemon and a stub process. ``None`` is treated as an empty set,
            meaning nothing is rewritten at all.
        pooling_enabled: ``config.mcp_gateway.enabled``. Sharing is global over
            the stub set: when ``False`` no stub is marked shareable, so each
            connection gets its own backend while the stubs stay in place — the
            state that lets a stubbed server render UI without co-tenancy.

    Returns:
        A ``(results, target_env)`` tuple:

        * ``results``: mapping ``{agent_filename: wrapped_server_count}``.
          Agents with no MCP servers are omitted.
        * ``target_env``: mapping ``{KIROCREW_MCP_TARGET_<SERVER>: "cmd arg arg"}``
          suitable for ``GatewaySpec.mcp_target_env``. Gatewayd consults
          these when a stub registers, to find the real backend command
          to spawn for a new pool key.
