"""Claim-push: the gateway tells gatewayd which session owns a runtime.

The claim event ("session S now owns kiro-cli PID P") is born in the main
gateway process at warm-pool ``rekey()`` time — with both the session key and
the runtime PID in hand. Before this module, that information reached gatewayd
only indirectly: the dashboard wrote ``session_pid_<pid>.txt`` and each stub
polled for it (``stub._recaller_loop``) with a bounded budget. Pool processes
claimed after the budget expired stayed identity-less for life (empty
``_meta.caller`` on every forwarded call → ``spawn_run`` records an empty
``parent_session`` → subagent completions fall back to notification-only).

Claim-push inverts the flow: the knower pushes. On ``rekey()`` the gateway
sends a one-shot ``claim`` frame over the gatewayd unix socket::

    {"type": "claim", "pid": <kiro_pid>, "caller": {"session_key": ..., ...}}

gatewayd applies it to every live stub connection whose ``parent_pid`` matches
(see ``gatewayd`` claim handling). Unlike the stub-initiated ``recaller``
frame — which is deny-by-default and must never overwrite an existing
identity — the claim frame originates from the gateway itself (same uid-gated
0700 socket trust level as Register), so it is allowed to REPLACE a stale
identity. That is what keeps the caller correct across warm-pool re-claims.

The stub-side recaller poll is kept as a fallback for gatewayd-restart races,
but claim-push is the primary, event-driven path.

Import-light on purpose: imported from ``acp/client.py`` and
``acp/session_provider.py`` (hot paths) and must not pull in config loading.
The only non-stdlib imports are ``platform_compat`` (process start tokens for
the PID-recycle guard), ``executors`` (offloads the /proc token read from the
event loop), and ``mcp_gateway.transport`` — all already in the
``transport -> platform_compat -> executors`` chain, which reaches no config
loader; transport is needed because the endpoint is a unix socket on POSIX
and a named pipe on Windows, and this module must not know which.
