"""Backend subprocess lifecycle for pooled MCP servers.

A :class:`Backend` is one real MCP subprocess (e.g. a ``slack-mcp`` launcher) the gateway spawned on behalf of one or more stubs. It owns
stdin/stdout pipes, tracks whether the backend's ``initialize`` response
advertised the ``kirocrew.caller-identity`` capability (pooled operation),
and exposes a graceful shutdown path that escalates to ``SIGKILL`` after a
deadline.

Milestone 1 scope: spawn, handshake via ``initialize``, graceful shutdown.
JSON-RPC fan-out routing and per-call identity injection live in
Milestone 3 when the full bridge ships.

    Capability follows the STUB, not a new preference. This function only ever

    broker for a server the operator stubbed, so the opt-in has already happened
    by the time control is here. That is why there is no *forward-facing* apps
    switch any more: a preference could not grant the feature (with no stub there
    is no render or callback path to grant).

    What survives is the two ways an operator can still say **no**:

    1. ``KIROCREW_MCP_APPS`` off -> disabled. Absolute kill switch, for tests,
       the e2e harness, and an operator who wants a stubbed server's backend
       shared without its server-authored UI.
    2. A stored ``mcp_gateway.apps_enabled = false`` -> disabled, EVEN with the
       env flag on. This key is retired going forward — nothing writes it, the
       MCP Management page does not surface it, and the docs no longer teach it —
       but a released version honoured it as a trustworthy opt-out, so a config
       that already carries ``false`` keeps its opt-out. Dropping it here would
       silently start executing server-authored UI for the one operator who took
       the trouble to turn it off. It defaults True when absent, so this fires
       only on a value someone actually wrote: "not configured" is not an opt-out.

    The released gate had a third leg — it also required ``mcp_gateway.enabled``,
    because back then the broker existed only when sharing was on. That leg is
    deliberately gone, and it costs no released behaviour: under the current
    migration ``enabled: false`` resolves to an EMPTY stub set, so no stub, no
    backend, and this gate never runs for such an install.

    Fails CLOSED: if config cannot be read, the feature is disabled. An
    unreadable config in gatewayd is an abnormal state, and silently disabling an
    optional rendering feature is the low-harm outcome versus rendering against
    an operator preference we could not confirm.

    Read per-call (``KiroCrewConfig.load`` is fingerprint-cached, so this is a

        Three sources, because a response can be owed at three different stages
        and each one alone is an incomplete signal:

        1. ``_pending_requests`` — forwarded requests awaiting a backend reply.
           Every entry is keyed by a gateway-minted ``_next_forward_id()`` frame
           id. The gateway's own heartbeat ping is written straight to the
           backend's stdin under the reserved :data:`HEARTBEAT_PING_ID` and is
           deliberately NOT registered here, so an idle backend cannot look busy.
        2. Unfinished ``_apps_tasks`` — MCP Apps interception
           (:meth:`_fetch_and_deliver_ui`) consumes the pending entry and then
           does the out-of-band ``resources/read`` + spool write + delivery in a
           background task.
        3. Queued ``_stub_inboxes`` frames — the stdout pump pops the pending
           entry and ENQUEUES serialised bytes; the connection handler's writer
           task drains that queue onto the stub socket. Between those two steps
           the reply exists but has not reached the stub.

        Counting only (1) would let a shutdown cancel the connection while a
        completed reply sat in a queue or a delivery task, silently losing it.

        Used as the shutdown drain predicate (see
        ``gatewayd._has_outstanding_work``) — "is a response still owed?" —
        which is a different question from ``refcount`` ("is a stub attached?").
        A pooled stub stays attached for the life of its session, so refcount

    each :class:`PoolKey` and includes it in the hash; spawning with a
    different env than the key claims is a correctness bug that would
    allow cross-tenant leakage.

    Security boundary (accepted risk, documented in
    ``docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`` under MCP Gateway): backends
    spawned here do NOT run inside a Linux mount namespace. The per-session
    sandbox applied in ``AcpClient._spawn()`` protects kiro-cli sessions,
    not gateway-spawned backends. Compensating controls:

    1. ``command`` is taken verbatim from ``KIROCREW_MCP_TARGET_<SERVER>`` env
       vars populated at KiroCrew startup by the rewriter from the user's
       own ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json``. Stubs cannot cause gatewayd to spawn
       an arbitrary binary — only pre-approved MCP servers.
    2. ``GatewayManager._scrub_sensitive_env()`` strips AWS / SSH / GPG /
       git credential env vars before gatewayd inherits them, so spawned
       backends do not inherit credential env (file-level access to
       ``~/.aws`` etc. is a known residual risk — backends that need AWS
       credentials read them from disk via ``ada`` / default credential
       chain, same as today's non-pooled topology).
    3. Backends run as the invoking user's UID, same as kiro-cli —
       the pool does not elevate privileges.

    Tightening this to a full mount namespace for pooled backends is tracked
    as Phase-2 hardening; broader rollout is gated on it.
