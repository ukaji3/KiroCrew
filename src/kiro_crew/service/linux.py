"""systemd system-service generation and control for Linux.

The unit lives at ``/etc/systemd/system/kirocrew.service`` and is
enabled+started via ``sudo systemctl enable --now``. The service runs
as the invoking user (via ``User=`` in the unit) — only the install,
uninstall, and start/stop actions need sudo.

Why system-level instead of user-level (``systemctl --user``):
some older distros (notably systemd 219) do not have a working
per-user systemd manager — ``systemctl --user`` fails with
``Failed to get D-Bus connection``. System-level units work
uniformly across any distro shipping systemd >= 219, which is
everything since 2015.

Sudo scope: only the systemctl/tee invocations in this file run under
sudo. The Python interpreter that imports MCP / LLM / agent code never
runs as root. The actual gateway runs as ``User=$USER`` once started.

    systemd splits unquoted ``ExecStart`` / ``Environment=`` tokens on

    ``KIROCREW_SERVICE_BIN`` / ``KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`` override, ``PATH`` entries
    with spaces, etc.) must be wrapped in double quotes. Inside a double-quoted
    token systemd honours C-style escapes, so ``\\`` and ``"`` are
    backslash-escaped.

    ``%`` is escaped to ``%%`` *first* (before quoting): systemd performs
    specifier expansion on ``ExecStart`` / ``Environment=`` values regardless of
    quoting — an unescaped ``%h`` / ``%i`` in a path (e.g. a directory literally
    named ``100%``) would be replaced with the home dir / instance name and the
    exec would target the wrong path. See systemd.unit(5) "Specifiers",
    systemd.service(5) "Command lines", and systemd.exec(5) ``Environment=``.

    A control character — most dangerously a newline — is rejected outright
    (``ValueError``) rather than escaped. A double-quoted systemd token does not
    span physical lines, so a newline in an operator override
    (``KIROCREW_SERVICE_BIN`` / ``KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN``) would terminate the value
    and let the remainder be parsed as fresh unit directives — e.g. injecting
    ``User=root`` + a replacement ``ExecStart`` into the root-owned unit that
    ``sudo … service install`` writes (a privilege-escalation vector). No
    legitimate executable path or locale contains a C0/DEL control character, so
    refusing them is strictly safer than trying to escape them.
