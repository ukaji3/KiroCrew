        Injected once at session start, not on every message.

        When *compressed_history* is provided, it replaces the naive
        truncation of thread history.  Callers obtain it by awaiting
        ``compress_thread_history()`` before calling this method.

        *model_window* is the active model's context window in tokens; every
        section cap is scaled proportionally to it (see ``_resolve_caps``) so a
        section keeps the SAME share of the window on a 200K model as on a 1M
        model. ``None``/unset falls back to the 1M reference (the default
        deployment's effective window), leaving that path byte-for-byte
        unchanged.

        All providers — including ``provider_type="claude_code"`` — receive the
        same injected context (critical rules, thread history, memory, skills,
        lessons); steering files are the one exception (see below). This keeps
        Claude Code at parity with kiro so dashboard/Slack UI contracts (diff
        blocks, OPTIONS buttons, file links) and prior conversation context
        behave identically across providers.

        *provider_type* is consumed again for the steering gate only: the
        steering block below is injected solely on the CC backend
        (``provider_type == "claude_code"``). kiro-cli loads an agent's
        ``resources`` natively when spawned with ``--agent`` (acp/client.py
        ``_spawn``), so re-injecting steering on the ACP/kiro backend would
        duplicate what kiro already loaded; the CC backend (claude-agent-acp)
        does NOT read agent ``resources`` and still needs the explicit load.
        Everything else stays at CC/ACP parity.

        *context_groups* selects which switchable groups are injected (see
        ``SWITCHABLE_CONTEXT_GROUPS``). ``None`` — every caller except a
        sub-agent whose parent opted a group out — injects all of them, so the
        output is unchanged. Omitting a group skips its sections entirely rather
        than capping them to zero: a zero cap yields a truncation marker, not an
        empty string. A sub-agent that had a group withheld is told so by name
        (``_build_context_scope_section``) so it reports the gap instead of
        guessing.

        For custom agents (non-kirocrew), skills and workspace identity
        are skipped — the agent loads its own via kiro-cli. Memory,
        lessons, critical rules, and hooks are injected for all agents.
