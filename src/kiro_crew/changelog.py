"""Parse ``CHANGELOG.md`` into per-version entries for the Releases archive.

## Why this is a module and not a handler helper

The dashboard's Releases archive needs the changelog as *data* (one entry per
version, each independently selectable) rather than as one markdown blob. The
parsing is a pure string function with no I/O, so it lives here and is tested
directly — the handler in ``dashboard/handlers/updates.py`` only reads the file
and calls in.

## What the list contains, and why it is not "every version"

An entry earns its place by having something to say. Two sources qualify:

1. A ``## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`` section actually present in ``CHANGELOG.md``.
2. The release the *running build* belongs to, whether or not it has a section.

Nothing else is listed. Versions that shipped without a changelog section are
deliberately absent: a row that cannot say anything is worse than no row,
because the reader cannot tell it apart from a broken one. The running build's
release is the one exception, because "what am I on?" is the question the page
is opened to answer, and leaving it out would answer it with someone else's
version number — which is exactly the defect this replaces.

## Prereleases are not entries

``0.2.0-rc.1`` and ``0.2.0-nightly.20260806t065257`` are both *drafts of
0.2.0*, not releases of their own. Listing them as siblings of 0.2.0 would be
the wrong hierarchy, and nightly would add ~4 rows a day forever. Both collapse
onto a single ``0.2.0`` entry flagged :attr:`Release.in_progress`, so one
mechanism serves both channels and the list does not move when 0.2.0 is
eventually promoted — the row is already there and merely loses the flag.
