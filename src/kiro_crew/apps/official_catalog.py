"""Fetch the official app catalog and annotate registry rows with it.

WHAT THIS IS. The catalog at ``apps.crew.kiro.dev`` is the list Kiro Crew
publishes, delivered as a document rather than baked into the wheel. The bundled
``app-registry.json`` answers the same question offline -- it is the seed -- so
both carry ``provenance: "official"``; see ``_apply_trust_fields``.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, YET. Three deliberate omissions, each a fail-closed gate here
rather than an ignored field, so the first time one matters it surfaces loudly
instead of degrading silently:

- **No signature verification.** The catalog is KMS-signed and a ``.sig`` sidecar
  is published beside it, but nothing here checks it. Trust is therefore TLS to
  our own domain -- the same basis on which the installer already fetches the
  CLI wheel, not a new low, but strictly less than the signature would give. The
  consequence is enforced below: a curated author does NOT mint the verified
  mark while this is true.
- **No tombstone resolution.** ``removed`` / ``reinstated`` carry withdrawal
  history with date precedence and a fail-closed tie rule. Implementing half of
  that would be worse than not implementing it, so a document carrying either
  list non-empty is REFUSED outright and the client falls back to the seed. A
  withdrawn app must never be rendered because we skipped the mechanism that
  withdraws it.
- **Display-only inventory.** ``list_catalog_rows`` maps the published list's
  DISPLAY fields (identity, name, summary, version, tags, author, asset refs)
  into storefront rows. It emits no clone coordinates and no ``origin``, because
  the catalog is trusted only as far as TLS: install coordinates stay with the
  seed and external registries, and a non-builtin row never mints the verified
  badge. ``list_catalog_apps`` intersects the rendered set with the seed's
  installable entries, so a catalog-only ``git`` name renders nothing until it is
  installable.

    The cache under the data home is not a sensitive path, so the agent's own file
    tools can write it (verified against ``security.is_sensitive_write_path``). That
    is harmless while the cache only supplies display copy, which is all
    :func:`annotate` consumes. It is NOT harmless once a row supplies install
    coordinates: an attacker who can write that file chooses which repository a name
    the owner has already permitted for execution installs from, and app trust is
    keyed by NAME. Reading coordinates from an agent-writable file would make the
    name-to-URL binding attacker-controlled.

    So the install path re-fetches the document over HTTPS and ignores the cache
    entirely. Someone able to write a local file cannot answer for
    ``apps.crew.kiro.dev``, and TLS to our own domain is the trust basis this module
    already documents. This is NOT a substitute for verifying the ``.sig`` sidecar --
    that would also close the case where the CDN itself is wrong -- but it removes
    the local surface, which is the one this client creates for itself.

    this document is ours, the manifest belongs to the app. `summary` lands on
    `description` -- it is the one-line list copy the store row renders.

    The curated author is applied for DISPLAY only. It deliberately does not
    reach ``_index_author``, which is what ``_apply_trust_fields`` derives the
    verified mark from: with signature verification not yet implemented, the
    catalog is trusted only as far as TLS, and TLS to a CDN is not evidence for
    a first-party badge. Wiring the author into the badge is the natural next
    step AFTER the signature is checked, not before.

    ``GET /api/apps/registry`` handler with no try/except above it, so a raise
    here is a 500 for the entire store -- the opposite of this module's promise
    that a bad catalog degrades to the seed.

    ``version`` is deliberately NOT overlaid. It looks like a display field and
    is not one: ``annotate`` runs BEFORE ``_enrich_with_install_status``, so a
    version written here reaches ``_version_newer`` and decides whether a row
    shows an update badge. A curated value would then be able to fabricate an
    update the app never published, or mask one it did, and it would couple this
    document to every app's release cadence forever. Version is a fact about the
