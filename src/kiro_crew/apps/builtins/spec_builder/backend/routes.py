"""Spec Builder — builtin backend routes.

Registered at gateway startup by ``dashboard/server.py``'s builtin-route loop
(``for name in BUILTIN_NAMES: _mod.register_routes(app)``), via the app's
``backend.routes`` manifest field (``"backend.routes:register_routes"``) — the
same in-process contract every other builtin app uses (see
``issue_radar``/``code_review_sage``). Handlers register on the gateway's
aiohttp ``Application`` with full ``/api/apps/spec-builder/*`` paths and reach
gateway state via ``request.app['state']``.

Responsibilities:
  * Spec CRUD backed by an app-owned index + the Kiro-standard markdown files.
  * A per-spec agent slot (the "Spec agent") the UI chats with IN-APP: user turns
    are relayed into the slot and the transcript is read back for the embedded chat.
  * Configurable storage: specs default to ``<working_dir>/.kiro/specs/<name>/``
    (portable to Kiro IDE/CLI); an optional absolute base-path override is honored.
  * Handoff: inject an execution instruction into the spec's session and arm an
    autonudge loop so it works through ``tasks.md`` autonomously.

    a run (nor touch another spec's sentinel on the way).

    With *name* and *expect_slot_key*, the identity is re-checked under the index
    lock and the sentinel is armed WITHIN THE SAME critical section, and a
