"""PPTX Maker — one-time provisioning of the vendored engine and app resources.

The presentation engine is a separate public OSS project, so it is not vendored
into this repository. It is fetched as a **digest-pinned tarball** into the app's
data dir on first use (see :mod:`.engine_source`), given its own uv-managed
virtualenv, and then the app's agent configs are rendered against the resulting
absolute paths.

**Nothing has to be installed by hand.** ``pip install kirocrew`` is the only
prerequisite: ``uv`` is a declared Python dependency and is resolved through the
installed package (:func:`resolve_uv`) rather than assumed to be on ``PATH``, and
the engine arrives over plain HTTPS, so ``git`` is no longer required at all.

Why this is a Python job and not a ``setup.onInstall`` shell script: a BUILTIN
app's source lives read-only inside the installed Python package, and the
platform only writes ``app.json``/``installed.json`` into
``~/.kiro/crew/apps/<name>/`` — it never stages a builtin's other files there. A
``setup.onInstall`` script therefore has nothing to run (the lifecycle runner
execs with that directory as its cwd), and manifest-declared ``agents``/``skills``
paths resolve to files that do not exist. This module closes that gap for this
app by staging its own resources into the install dir and then calling the
platform's OWN registrar (``bridges.register_app``) rather than re-implementing
agent symlinking or skill linking here.

Provisioning is user-triggered (``POST /engine/provision``) and idempotent, so
re-running it after an app update re-points the agents at the current engine.

Everything here is BLOCKING (network, uv, file copies) and runs on the subprocess
executor via ``routes.off_loop`` — never on the gateway event loop.
