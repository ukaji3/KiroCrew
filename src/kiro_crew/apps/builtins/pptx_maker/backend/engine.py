"""PPTX Maker — the vendored engine bridge.

The presentation engine (`spec-driven-presentation-maker`, public OSS) is fetched
as a digest-pinned tarball into the app's data dir with its own uv-managed
virtualenv (see :mod:`.engine_source`). This module is the ONLY place that talks
to it, and it talks in exactly two ways:

* :func:`engine_status` — cheap filesystem probes for the provisioning banner.
* :func:`run_engine_snippet` — run a fixed Python snippet inside the engine venv
  and parse its JSON stdout.

Why call the engine as a subprocess rather than importing it: it is a separately
versioned third-party checkout with its own dependency closure (``lxml``,
``python-pptx``), installed into its own venv. Importing it into the gateway
process would put an unpinned dependency set on the gateway's import path.

Every function here is BLOCKING and must be called through
:func:`kiro_crew.apps.builtins.pptx_maker.backend.routes.off_loop` (which hands
it to ``subprocess_executor()``). Nothing in this module may be awaited
directly — a ``subprocess.run`` on the gateway's single event loop freezes every
session (AUTOSDE ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``).

The snippets are module-level constants, never built from request data: the
engine is driven through its own documented Python API, and the only values that
cross the boundary are ``argv`` entries the caller has already contained through
``paths.py``.
