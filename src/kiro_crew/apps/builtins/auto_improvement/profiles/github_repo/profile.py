"""The reference Target Profile: any Python GitHub repo with a pytest suite.

This is the concrete profile the ported spine was missing. It assembles the six
seam fields of :mod:`...spine.profile` for a target that is *just a git repo*:

  ① :class:`SuiteRuler`       wall-clock seconds of the repo's own test suite
  ② :class:`PytestBuildGate`  ``pytest -q`` — boolean + the gated commit sha
  ②b :class:`PytestBugRunner` the RED/GREEN primitives (import smoke, lint, collect,
                              one nodeid, full suite)
  ③ :class:`RepoEditAllowlist` source globs in, tests-of-record + CI config out
  ④ :class:`RepoIsolation`    the push-disabled clone + do-not-pollute paths
  ⑤ ``GitHubPRRecipe``        reused verbatim from :mod:`.pr_recipe`
  ⑥ ``CalibrationParams``     reps + a seconds noise floor + the canary id

## Why a repo target is the *easy* case for four of the six fields

A repo has no runtime to boot, no container split, no bind mounts, and no frozen
component tree: a fresh ``pytest`` process IS the measurement. So ``single_environment``
is True (build and measure are co-located — the spine skips its cross-environment
sha assertion), ``frozen_components`` is empty, and ``measurement_boot()`` is a
documented no-op. Those are honest answers to the protocol, not stubs: see each
member's docstring for why the degenerate answer is the *correct* one here.

## Where the spine hands us ``<tree>/src`` unconditionally

Three spine call-sites build a source path by appending ``src`` with no existence
check — ``Measurer(base_src=clone/"src")``, ``calibrate_and_prove(base_src=
clone/"src")``, and ``Gate`` passing ``worktree/"src"``. A flat repo (``foo.py`` at
the root, no ``src/`` package dir) therefore arrives here as a path that does not
exist. Every adapter in this module funnels its incoming tree through
:func:`_repo_root`, which walks up to the real repo root. The driver itself already
uses that same fallback idiom (``src = clone/"src"; if not src.exists(): src =
clone``), so this is the established convention rather than a workaround.

## The canary is a LOWER BOUND here (documented limitation)

The Phase-1 canary must be a *known* win that clears the calibrated noise band.
For a purpose-built runtime you force one by flipping a disabled fast path. An
arbitrary Python repo offers no such switch: we cannot know a priori which edit
makes ITS suite measurably faster, and fabricating one (patching in a
``time.sleep`` to remove) would prove only that the ruler can see a sleep — not
that it can resolve the small deltas real candidates produce.

So :meth:`SuiteRuler.measure_canary` forces the one win that is genuinely known
and genuinely mechanical: it runs the suite with collect-only on the candidate arm,
so the candidate arm skips all test *execution* while both arms pay the same
interpreter start + collection cost. That is a real, correctly-signed delta measured
through the full ruler — but it is a *lower bound* on sensitivity, not proof that the
ruler resolves a 3% win.

A canary that does not clear even that lower bound therefore means the ruler is not
trusted on this target, and the perf run HALTS (``canary_advisory`` defaults to False —
the §7.1 contract). It ran advisory-by-default for a while on the argument that strictness
would also halt bug-track runs; it does not, because ``Driver.run`` skips ruler pre-flight
entirely for the bug track. An operator whose target genuinely cannot force a measurable
win can still opt in to warn-and-continue explicitly.

Two consequences worth stating plainly. First, the canary is sampled over
``_CANARY_REPS`` pairs and aggregated by median, because a single pair lets one
scheduling hiccup pick the sign. Second, on a repo whose suite runs in about the time
its own collection takes, skipping every test saves nothing measurable — there is no
win to force, so the canary returns ``ok=False`` with that stated in the note. It does
NOT return a delta whose sign the noise chose. Such a repo is simply not a target a
wall-clock suite ruler can prove a perf win on; configuring ``benchmarkCommand`` to
point at a real workload is the fix. Such a repo can still be used for the BUG track,
which never calibrates or consults the ruler at all.

    Deliberately the RUNNING interpreter rather than a ``pytest`` found on PATH: the
    interpreter executing the gateway is the one with the app's dependencies
    installed, and a PATH ``pytest`` from a different environment is the classic
    source of "collection error" verdicts that look like a real RED but are not.
    ``-p no:cacheprovider`` keeps pytest from writing ``.pytest_cache`` into the tree
    (a write the do-not-pollute discipline would rightly flag). ``--color=no`` keeps
    the summary machine-readable: pytest colorizes ``FAILED``/``ERROR`` lines — and the
    test name INSIDE the nodeid — whenever color is on, and a nodeid carrying escape
    sequences cannot be handed back to pytest to re-run.

    ``-o addopts=`` is load-bearing: the TARGET repo's own ini ``addopts`` otherwise
    apply to every invocation we make, and a repo that ships coverage + ``-n auto``
    makes each gate step pay whole-package instrumentation and full xdist worker
    startup. Measured on this repo, collecting ONE trivial test: **73.9s with the
    repo's addopts, 0.17s with them overridden** — a ~430x difference, and it also
    wrote a coverage report into the tree. That cost is charged FOUR times per
    candidate (T2 collect, RED, GREEN, STAYGREEN), so a valid candidate could blow the
    180s quick timeout and be recorded as "reproducing test does not collect" — a
    harness artifact reported as a defect in the agent's test. It also protects
    MEASUREMENT VALIDITY: coverage instrumentation and xdist scheduling are exactly
    the variance the A/B noise band exists to exclude, so paying them inside a timed
    arm measures the harness, not the change.

    Note ``-o addopts=`` and NOT ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS=""``: an env ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS`` is
    APPENDED to the ini value rather than replacing it, so the empty string is inert
    (verified — coverage still ran). Overriding the ini key is what actually drops them.

        interpreter start + collection cost, so the delta is exactly the suite's
        execution time: correctly-signed (negative for minimize) and requiring no edit
        to the repo. It proves the ruler can resolve a win of that size, which is a
        LOWER BOUND on sensitivity, not proof it resolves a 3% win — which is precisely
        why the supervisor runs the canary advisory.

        Both arms are sampled ``_CANARY_REPS`` times and aggregated by MEDIAN for the
        same reason the spine's measurer does it: a single pair lets one scheduling

        yields ``delta < 0`` and clears the sensitivity check without the ruler ever being
        exercised. There is no mechanically-known win for an arbitrary command, so refuse to
