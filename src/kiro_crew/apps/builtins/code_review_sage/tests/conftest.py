"""Collection-time platform gate for the Code Review Sage suite.

The app itself refuses to run off POSIX — `sage_lib/discovery.py` raises
"Code Review Sage requires a POSIX platform (macOS/Linux); run the Kiro Crew
gateway under WSL on Windows" — so these tests assert POSIX behaviour throughout:
`0600` file modes, forward-slash path suffixes, and a `gh` binary the Windows
runner never reaches because the platform guard fires first.

Running them on Windows therefore tests a configuration the app does not support,
and the failures say nothing about the code. Skip the suite there rather than
teaching nine assertions to be platform-agnostic for a platform the app rejects.

This lives here, next to the suite it gates, so the reason travels with the tests
rather than sitting in a CI workflow that would hide it.
