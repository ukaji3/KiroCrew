"""Task routes — read/edit the extracted task list and file reviewed tasks.

``GET    …/{id}/tasks``           the meeting's extracted tasks
``POST   …/{id}/tasks``           add a task by hand
``PATCH  …/{id}/tasks``           edit one task's fields
``DELETE …/{id}/tasks``           remove a task
``POST   …/{id}/tasks/file``      file a task through the task provider
``GET    …/task-providers``       registered providers (for the settings picker)

Filing goes through the :mod:`..providers.tasks` seam — the shipped provider is
the local KiroCrew ledger. Upstream instead composed a natural-language prompt
naming a company-internal tracker and handed it to a dedicated agent; that agent
and its internal MCP servers are gone.

Every store read and write here is BLOCKING and runs on a worker thread via
``asyncio.to_thread``; the module-level ``_`` helpers are the grouped bodies those
threads execute. Each read-modify-write of ``tasks.json`` is inside ONE helper AND
under ``_TASKS_LOCK``: one thread hop keeps the read and the write together, and the
lock keeps two hops from interleaving. Both are needed — worker threads run
concurrently, and "Archive all" issues one request per task, so without the lock the
last write wins and every other update is discarded while all of them report success.

``handle_file_task`` is the one helper whose write must follow an ``await`` (only a
successful provider call may be recorded), so it cannot share a hop. It therefore
RE-READS under the lock in :func:`_record_filing` and applies only that task's two
fields, instead of writing the snapshot it captured before the await — which would
have reverted anything the extractor agent or another request changed meanwhile.

    Runs on a worker thread, never the event loop, and grouped into ONE hop for the
    same read-modify-write reason as :func:`_patch_task`.

    ``pushed`` is TERMINAL and is never overwritten here. It is not a third value
    this endpoint may set — it is the record that the task was actually filed with an
    external provider, written by :func:`_record_filing` together with the
    ``filed_ref`` that identifies the created item.

    The freshly-read status is what decides, not the caller's snapshot, so the check
    covers the race as well as the plain case: File and then Archive All (or a
    delayed archive from a second tab) had the archive land after the provider call
    returned, replacing ``pushed`` with ``archived``. The task then dropped out of the
    filed set and could be filed a SECOND time — a duplicate item in the tracker for
    one action item, with the original's ``filed_ref`` gone.

    Answers success rather than a conflict: the caller asked for a review disposition
    on a task whose disposition is already settled more strongly, so there is nothing
    for them to resolve and the response still carries the true list.
