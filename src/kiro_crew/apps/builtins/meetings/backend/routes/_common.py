"""Shared request plumbing for the Meetings routes.

Holds the pieces every handler needs and nothing route-specific:

* :func:`require_enabled` — the deny-by-default authorization decorator. The app
  is ``defaultEnabled: false`` and routes are registered once at gateway
  startup, so without this a disabled app would stay callable.
* :func:`json_body` / the ``field_*`` helpers — input validation. Every value
  that reaches the filesystem or a model prompt goes through one of these.
* :data:`ACTIVE` — the single active meeting (``MAX_CONCURRENT_MEETINGS == 1``).
* :func:`error_response` — uniform error mapping, including the
  :class:`~..store.MeetingsPathError` → status translation.
