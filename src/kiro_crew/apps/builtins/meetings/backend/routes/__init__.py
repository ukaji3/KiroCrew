"""Meetings — route registration.

Registered at gateway startup by ``dashboard/server.py``'s builtin loop (which
imports the app package and calls its ``register_routes``); the manifest field
``backend.routes = "backend.routes:register_routes"`` names the same entry point
for the generic App Kit loader.

Every handler lives under ``/api/apps/meetings/*`` on the gateway's OWN aiohttp
Application — same-origin, behind the dashboard's token auth. Upstream instead
ran ``web.run_app`` on its own port and called back into the gateway over
authenticated loopback HTTP; that whole second server (and its copy of the auth
path) is gone.

Handlers are wrapped by :func:`.._common.route`, which applies the
deny-by-default enable gate and turns validation failures into 4xx.

    ``SIGKILL``, an OOM, a crash, a power loss — and that is precisely when a
    meeting is most likely to be mid-flight. So the same false-``active`` state the
    cleanup hook exists to prevent is reachable by simply not letting the hook run.

    Startup is the only place to repair it, and it is a sound place: ``ACTIVE`` is

    meeting on disk claiming a non-terminal status is provably orphaned — there is

    The live session lives only in this process's memory, but the meeting's status
    lives on disk — so dropping one without the other leaves the two disagreeing.
    A gateway restart during an ACTIVE meeting persisted ``active`` while ``ACTIVE``
    came back empty, and that combination is worse than either half:

    * the dashboard reads ``active`` and shows Live, and its transcription binding
      keys off exactly that status, so the browser keeps recording;
    * every resulting dispatch answers 409 ``no_active_meeting``, so the speech is
      dropped rather than queued — the notes just stop, mid-meeting, with the UI
      still claiming to be listening;
    * ``handle_start_meeting`` cannot recover it either, because ``idle -> active``
      is the only transition out of a fresh meeting and this one is not idle.

    Marking it ended is what makes the state honest: the meeting shows Ended, and
    ``ended -> active`` is an allowed transition, so the Restart button is exactly
    the affordance the user needs. That path re-runs ``init_agents``, which is why
    a restarted meeting's agents get their instructions back (see
    ``handle_start_meeting``).

    must happen while the session still exists. Neither step may break shutdown.
