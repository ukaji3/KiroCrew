"""Papyrus — on-disk project layout and path containment.

Every paper lives under ``~/.kiro/crew/apps/papyrus/data/projects/<name>/`` (via
:func:`kiro_crew.apps.manager.app_data_dir`, the platform-standard app-scoped
data dir). Nothing is stored outside that tree and nothing is uploaded anywhere.

``root`` is accepted on every function (mirroring ``issue_radar``'s ``store.py``)
so tests can point at a tmp dir instead of the real app data dir.

**This module is the app's path-containment gate.** A LaTeX editor writes
user-controlled relative paths and hands a directory to an external compiler, so
two rules hold everywhere:

* every caller-supplied path goes through :func:`safe_child` before it reaches
  the filesystem — it rejects absolute paths, ``..`` in any segment, backslashes
  (a Windows-style separator that would sidestep a ``/``-only check), NUL bytes,
  and — after ``resolve()`` — anything that does not land inside the project;
* a project NAME goes through :func:`safe_project_dir`, which additionally
  refuses anything that is not a single slug segment, so a project name can
  never introduce a path separator of its own.

Both are synchronous filesystem code: call them from a worker thread
(``asyncio.to_thread`` / ``run_in_executor``), never on the event loop for a
large tree.
