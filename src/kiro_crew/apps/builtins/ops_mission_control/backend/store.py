"""Ops Mission Control — incident store and dispatch index.

The dispatch index (``incidents/index.json``) is the claim ledger: it is what
makes a firing signal *owned* rather than merely visible. Two properties matter
and are enforced here rather than by convention:

**Claims are atomic.** Two heartbeats (two Kiro Crew instances, or an overlapping
tick) must never both claim the same signal and spawn two investigations of one
incident. ``claim`` takes an exclusive file lock and does a compare-and-set, so
exactly one caller wins and the loser skips.

**Transitions are legal or refused.** An incident cannot jump from ``unclaimed``
straight to ``resolved`` — that would let the board assert work was done that no
investigation ever ran. ``models.LEGAL_TRANSITIONS`` is the whole grammar and
``transition`` is the only door.

File locking goes through ``platform_compat`` (never raw ``fcntl``) because this
app must work on Windows, where that module does not exist.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/ops-mission-control.md`` (incident store).

    a per-incident investigation file.

    somebody else, so a leaked credential in it is worse than having no postmortem at
    all — no artifact means an inconvenience, a poisoned artifact means a credential
    forwarded by hand, with the operator's own confidence behind it.

    and naming them here stops a later reader assuming they were forgotten.
    ``verification`` and ``last_action`` join that list for the same reason — both are
    closed enums we assign — while ``verification_detail`` DOES go through the redactor,
    because it quotes a provider's own poll-failure text.
