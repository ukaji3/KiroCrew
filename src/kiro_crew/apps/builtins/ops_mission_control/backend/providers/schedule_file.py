"""On-call rotation from a committed schedule file — no rotation service required.

A team that has PagerDuty already has a rotation API. This adapter is for everyone
else: the owner's ask was "assuming we do not have oncall service we just can keep
oncall schedule in that repository and for auth we can use github logins". So the
schedule is a YAML file that lives in the SAME git repo the knowledge ledger syncs
through (``ledger_sync``), and identity is the operator's GitHub login.

Why a file in git rather than a service:

- **It is already synced.** The ledger repo is the team's shared memory; a rotation
  is the same kind of small, slow-changing, human-edited fact. Reusing that transport
  means no second integration, no second credential, and the schedule arrives on the
  same pull that brings teammates' lessons.
- **It is reviewable.** A shift swap is a diff with an author and a timestamp. That is
  a better audit trail than most rotation UIs give you, and it is the same reason the
  ledger is JSONL in git rather than rows in a private DB.
- **It fails CLOSED, which is the opposite of what a rotation API should do.** Every
  indeterminate case — missing file, malformed YAML, unresolvable login, clock outside
  every window — resolves to ``on_shift=False, unknown=True`` under ``strict_gating``
  (default on). For an API, "cannot tell" means the network is down and arming is right.
  For a file every instance reads, "cannot tell" means the SCHEDULE is wrong, and arming
  makes the whole team pick up the same alarm. ``unknown`` survives so the UI can explain
  WHY; only ``on_shift`` gates work.

**This adapter never decides authority, only tier arming.** Being on shift arms the
``on_shift`` cron tier; it does not raise the autonomy mode. ``effective = min(app_mode,
rule_mode)`` still governs every action, so a schedule file — which any teammate can
edit and push — cannot escalate what the agent may DO. That separation is deliberate:
the schedule is shared, mutable, and only as trustworthy as the repo's write access, so
it is wired to the cheap decision (when to look) and not the expensive one (what to do).

Schedule format (``rotation.yaml`` at the repo root)::

    leader: octocat                   # optional; runs nightly ledger hygiene ALONE
    timezone: America/Los_Angeles     # optional; UTC when absent
    shifts:
      - from: 2026-08-01
        to: 2026-08-08
        who: octocat                  # a GitHub login
      - from: 2026-08-08T09:00
        to: 2026-08-15T09:00
        who: [octocat, hubot]         # co-primary is allowed
