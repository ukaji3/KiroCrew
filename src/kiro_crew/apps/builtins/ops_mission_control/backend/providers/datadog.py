"""Datadog adapters — monitors as signals, metrics as evidence, mute as action.

Datadog needs two secrets (an API key and an application key), which is why
``_REQUIRED_SECRETS`` has two entries and ``configured()`` demands both: a user who
enters only the API key gets "unconfigured" rather than a confusing 403 on every
poll.

The site is configurable (``datadoghq.com``, ``datadoghq.eu``, ``ddog-gov.com``,
…) because Datadog's API host is region-specific and a hardcoded US host silently
fails for every EU customer.
