"""Tests for the ``ops_mission_control_api`` MCP tool's authorization story.

The tool is the ONLY credentialed path from an agent session to the app's HTTP
surface (the ``issue_radar_record_investigation`` precedent: the MCP server
process holds the internal secret; the agent never sees a credential). Three
planes must stay mutually consistent, and each has a failure mode this module
pins:

- the **(method, path) allowlist** in ``validation.py`` — widening it is an
  authorization change and must look like one in review;
- the **schema** rejecting off-surface calls before any HTTP happens;
- the **gateway's mixed-internal path set** admitting exactly the allowlisted
  surface for internal-secret callers, and never the app's configuration,
  webhook-ingest, or human-decision routes.
