"""App registry — curated list of available KiroCrew apps.

The registry JSON (``app-registry.json``) is a minimal index: just app name,
git URL, branch, and install metadata.  All display information (description,
screenshots, highlights, tags, platform) comes from each app's own
``app.json``, fetched on demand and cached locally.

This "single source of truth" design means app authors only maintain their
own ``app.json`` — they never need to update the KiroCrew registry JSON
when changing descriptions, screenshots, or versions.

Each registry entry identifies the source repository via a ``gitUrl`` field
(any git-cloneable URL — ``https://github.com/...``, ``git@host:...``, etc.).
The legacy ``repo`` field is still accepted and, when no ``gitUrl`` is given,
is used as a clone target directly (so a full URL may be placed in ``repo``).

SECURITY — Trust model:
  registry JSON (gitUrl + branch) → ``git clone`` from the configured host →
  read app.json → execute setup.onInstall script.

The registry entry itself is curated/reviewed before being shipped, and the
install script in app.json has the same trust level as any code you clone
and build locally.  Install scripts run sandboxed via ``wrap_argv`` with a
minimal environment that excludes process secrets.

    Confused-deputy defense (companion to :func:`is_clone_host_trusted`): the
    clone-host trust gate is deliberately **host-granular**, so a host the owner
    configured for one registry (e.g. their internal forge) is trusted wholesale.
    A configured registry's ``app-registry.json`` is UNTRUSTED content, so it can
    list an app whose ``repo`` points at a *sibling* private repo on that same
    trusted host. The manifest/blob-proxy paths clone such repos **automatically**
    on browse/refresh — with no per-repo owner action — so cloning them with the
    gateway's ambient git/ssh identity would be a confused-deputy read of a
    private sibling repo, surfaced back through the App Store. Such automatic
    clones therefore run **credential-free / anonymous**:

    - drop the SSH agent + ``GIT_SSH``/``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` passthrough
      (``_GIT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_KEYS``) so no ssh key/agent is ever offered;
    - disable system **and** global git config (``GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`` +
      ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=os.devnull``) so no HTTPS credential helper fires;
    - never prompt (``GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0``, plus a batch-mode
      ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` with no identity/agent) so a private repo simply fails
      to clone (→ graceful fallback) instead of authenticating as the gateway.

    Callers must ALSO pass ``mode="strict"`` to :func:`wrap_argv` so the OS
    sandbox hides ``~/.ssh`` — env suppression and the sandbox are belt-and-
    suspenders on the same credential-free property.

    Credential posture by clone origin (all four paths gate on
    :func:`is_clone_host_trusted` first):

    - **Automatic** browse/refresh clones (manifest + blob proxy) — always
      credential-free / anonymous (this function), because no per-repo owner
      action gates them.
    - **Index-originated installs** — an app whose registry entry came from an
      owner-configured *external* index (carries ``_registry``): the ``repo``
      URL is index-controlled, so the install clone is ALSO credential-free
      (``anonymous_git_env`` + strict sandbox); the owner designated the index
      URL, not the app's repo. See :func:`_git_clone_or_pull`'s
      ``index_originated`` flag.
    - **Bundled / owner-designated installs** — the curated bundled registry (no
      ``_registry`` marker) and fetching the owner's own configured registry
      index keep full credentials via :func:`minimal_env`; those repos are
      deliberately owner-designated.

    Why this exists: registry ``repo`` fields are now full git URLs, and a

    UNTRUSTED content — it can list an app whose ``repo`` points at an internal
    address (e.g. ``https://127.0.0.1:8443/x``) or any attacker-controlled host.
    Such a value passes ``_is_safe_repo_identifier`` and enters the blob-proxy

    SECURITY CONTRACT: these two fields are the API trust boundary for
    ``GET /api/apps/registry``. They are computed here — where the
    server-attached ``_registry`` tag is authoritative — and OVERWRITE any
    value an index entry may have published, so an external registry can
    never spoof them. Client code must read these fields and must not
    re-derive trust from the absence of ``_registry``, an internal tagging
    detail. ``_registry`` stays in the payload: the external-source label
    text, older clients, ``appManifest.ts::keysFor`` (first-party copy
    gate), and ``pickFeatured``'s legacy arm all still read it — do not
    stop emitting or rename it without migrating those dependants.

    Per row:

    - ``provenance``: ``"external"`` when ``_registry`` is set (the tag is
      applied server-side per configured registry and cannot be forged by
      index content); otherwise ``"builtin"`` when ``origin == "builtin"``,
      else ``"official"``.

      ``"official"`` means "an app WE list", and the bundled
      ``app-registry.json`` is one delivery of that list — the offline seed
      that ships inside the wheel. It answers the same question the remote
      signed catalog answers, so it gets the same value rather than a second
      one: two provenance values for one claim would put a weaker integrity
      guarantee (rides on the install artifact, cannot be revoked before the
      next release) behind a label a client cannot tell apart from the
      stronger one. The value names WHOSE list an app is on; how that list
      reached the client is a separate axis, and belongs in a separate field
      once there is more than one answer to record.

      ``"core"`` was the previous spelling. Clients accept both during the
      migration, so an older gateway's rows still label correctly.
    - ``verified``: ``True`` only when provenance is NOT ``"external"`` AND
      (``origin == "builtin"`` or the INDEX-declared author — snapshotted
      into ``_index_author`` by ``list_registry`` before the manifest merge
      — names us after ``_fold_author`` (see ``FIRST_PARTY_AUTHORS``). The
      badge asserts first-party
      provenance next to an Install button that runs setup code with
      gateway privileges, so it is never awardable from index-published
      trust keys or from the repo-fetched ``app.json``: a third-party core
      repo publishing ``"author": "kirocrew"`` in its manifest does not
      mint it (the merged ``author`` display field is deliberately NOT
      consulted).
    - ``featured``: dropped entirely from external rows so an external index
      can never self-flag into the Discover spotlight, regardless of client
      logic. Core-entry ``featured`` flags are preserved.

    The registry index is cloned and parsed from exactly ``reg.branch``, so a
    same-repo entry declaring a different branch describes a state that does
    not exist on the ref the operator asked for (e.g. a pre-merge entry
    declaring ``main``); honouring it makes install clone a ref where the
    app's subdirectory is missing. The declared value is index-controlled
    (untrusted) content, while ``reg.branch`` already passed the branch regex
    gate before the fetch, so the override also narrows what a registry index
    can make the installer clone.

    A cross-repo entry — one whose effective clone URL differs from the
    configured registry repo — keeps its declaration: its branch names a ref
    in ANOTHER repository, about which ``reg.branch`` carries no information.
    The comparison is byte-identical string equality, matching the
    owner-designated carve-out semantics (no normalization, no host-level
    matching). A cross-repo entry with no usable declared branch still
    inherits ``reg.branch`` (an explicit JSON ``null`` counts as absent, so
    ``None`` can never flow to the clone coordinates).

    Runs at fetch finalisation AND on every cache read that feeds a branch
    consumer, so a cache written before the registry's branch config changed
    (or by a version that honoured per-app declarations) cannot keep an
    overridden branch alive until the next refresh. ``warn`` is set only on
