        tmp + ``os.replace`` rather than ``write_text`` for two reasons. A reader
        can observe this file without the lock (``load_all`` takes none), and
        ``atomic_write`` renames a unique temp file over the target, so a reader sees
        either the whole old file or the whole new one -- never a half-written one.
        That is what makes the unlocked read in ``load_all`` safe, so no lock has to
        be added there, and a crash mid-write can no longer truncate the store.

        Uses the repo's ``atomic_write`` rather than a hand-rolled temp + rename.
        Hand-rolling it re-introduced three problems the shared helper already
        solves: a temp name that two writers could collide on (it uses
        ``tempfile.mkstemp``), a bare ``os.replace`` that raises ``PermissionError``
        when Windows Search or AV holds a handle (it uses ``replace_with_retry``),
        and a replacement inode carrying umask permissions instead of the store's
        (it applies ``mode`` via ``fchmod_safe``).

        The mode is read off the existing file so a restrictive store stays
        restrictive -- ``write_text`` used to preserve it implicitly by reusing the
        inode, and swapping the inode silently dropped it. A store being created for
        the first time gets ``0o600``: lesson text is personal content, and nothing
        else needs to read it.

        ``newline=""`` keeps the bytes exact. The default would apply
        universal-newline translation on write, and this file is read, edited and
        written back on every save.

        The single lock acquisition is the load-bearing part. Doing enrich and
        insert as two separate locked calls let a concurrent writer insert the
        same rule in the gap, so the second call saw a duplicate and skipped --
        dropping the clause exactly as before, just less often. The whole
        read-decide-write sequence runs inside the lock, so there is no gap.

        Matching is ``lower()``, deliberately NOT ``casefold()``. This reversed an
        earlier decision in the same change, so the reasoning matters: ``casefold()``
        maps ``ß`` to ``ss`` in order to match a stored "Straße" against a submitted
        "STRASSE" -- but the very same mapping makes "Maße" and "Masse" compare EQUAL,
        and those are different German words. Under ``casefold()`` a clause submitted
        for "Masse" attached itself to the stored "Maße" and the intended lesson was
        never created: the wrong rule enriched, the right one discarded.

        The two behaviours are inseparable -- both come from the one ß rule -- so this
        is a trade, not a fix. ``lower()`` is the safe side of it: it never conflates
        two distinct rules, and its cost is a MISSED enrichment (a ß case-variant
        inserts a second row) rather than a corrupted one. Losing a refinement is
        recoverable; silently rewriting the wrong lesson is not.

        A re-submit carrying NO clause never strips one that is already stored --
