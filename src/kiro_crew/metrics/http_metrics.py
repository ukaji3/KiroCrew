"""Gateway HTTP observability — boot-to-ready + bounded per-route latency.

Two privacy-safe, BOUNDED-CARDINALITY signals for the aiohttp gateway
(``dashboard/server.py`` — both the full dashboard and the headless ``--slack-only``
API server):

  * ``kirocrew.gateway.boot.duration`` — a histogram (ms) of how long
    ``start_dashboard`` / ``start_api_server`` take from process-relative
    ``start_time`` until the server is fully initialised and about to accept
    traffic. Attrs: ``server`` (``dashboard`` / ``api``), ``outcome`` (``ready``).

  * ``kirocrew.gateway.request.duration`` — a histogram (ms) of per-request
    handling latency. Attrs: ``method``, ``route_template``, ``status_class``.

PRIVACY (hard rule): these metrics NEVER carry prompts, message content,
tokens, real request paths, query strings, user ids, or secrets. The only
request-derived labels are:

  * ``method``          — clamped to a fixed HTTP-verb allowlist (else ``OTHER``).
  * ``route_template``  — the *matched route's* aiohttp canonical TEMPLATE
                          (e.g. ``/api/artifacts/{slug}``), NOT the concrete path
                          (``/api/artifacts/abc123``). The ``{slug}`` placeholder
                          is a constant baked into the route table, so no id /
                          path segment / free-form value ever becomes a label.
  * ``status_class``    — the HTTP status bucketed to ``1xx``..``5xx`` / ``other``.

BOUNDED CARDINALITY (structural guarantee):
  The set of route templates is captured ONCE at server-build time from the
  registered route table (:func:`collect_route_templates`). At request time
  :func:`route_template` returns a template ONLY IF it is in that frozen set;
  anything else — an unmatched 404 (aiohttp ``SystemRoute``), or a route added
  after capture — collapses to the single sentinel :data:`UNKNOWN_ROUTE`.
  Therefore the number of distinct ``route_template`` label values is bounded by
  ``len(known_templates) + 1``, a constant fixed at startup that CANNOT grow with
  traffic. Combined with the fixed ``method`` allowlist (<= 8) and the fixed
  ``status_class`` domain (6), total series for the request histogram are bounded
  by ``(len(known_templates) + 1) * 8 * 6`` — no unbounded label can ever leak in.

OSS-CLEAN: depends only on ``aiohttp`` + the first-party metrics facade.
