    Returns ``(dropped, paused)`` — two lists, because they are two different
    outcomes and a caller that conflates them tells the user the wrong thing. A
    dropped job is gone; a paused one is fully restored and simply waiting to be
    switched on. Rewrites *crons_path* in place. A missing file is left alone.

    Three rules, each closing a different way an archive can act on the host:

    1. A job that is not an object, or whose ``schedule`` is not one, is DROPPED.
       ``CronService._load`` subscripts ``j["id"]`` and ``j["schedule"]["kind"]``
       directly and catches only ``JSONDecodeError``/``KeyError``, so ``null`` or
       a scalar in ``jobs`` raises ``TypeError`` straight out of the load. An
       importer must not be able to write a store the loader cannot read.

    2. A ``command`` is vetted with ``mcp_cron._vet_shell_command``, so it is
       judged exactly as the same command would be at ``cron_add`` (deny-list,
       sensitive-path, credential-path and exfiltration checks). A failure DROPS
       the job, and so does the vet itself raising — an unverifiable command must
       not be scheduled.

    3. A job that survives with a ``command``, and any job naming a ``script``,
       is imported DISABLED (``user_paused``) rather than live, and reported as
       PAUSED, not rejected. The vet bounds what a command may do, not whether the
       user asked for THIS command on THIS machine, and a ``script`` cannot be
       vetted at all: the export never carries the ``crons/`` directory, so the
       name resolves against whatever the target already has there. Both become an
       ambush if they start running on their own. Disabling keeps the restore — the
       jobs, their schedules and their history are all still there — while making
       the first run an explicit human action. Message-only jobs are untouched:
       they prompt an agent, they do not execute anything on the host.
