"""Time-limited safety override — replaces permanent YOLO mode.

Provides a ``SafetyOverride`` class with two kinds of grant:

- **Ad-hoc** — YOLO toggled mid-session from Slack, the dashboard picker or the
  API. Bounded by ONE duration shared by every surface (``agent.yolo_duration``,
  default 6 h, hard ceiling 24 h) and automatically expires. A 5-minute grace
  window after expiry allows renew() to reactivate without a full
  re-activation flow.
- **Declared** — ``agent.dangerously_skip_permissions: true`` in operator-owned
  config (the camelCase and legacy ``yolo`` spellings are also read). A standing
  instruction, so it does NOT expire: it is re-established and re-audited on
  every startup (state is in-memory), cleared the moment the operator picks
  another approval mode, and deniable by the enterprise governance ceiling via
  the ``yolo_duration`` scope's ``permanent`` member — which downgrades it to the
  ad-hoc duration.

Per-surface TTLs (30 min Slack / 6 h dashboard / 24 h config) were removed: the
same operator re-enabling the same grant got a different lifetime depending on
where they clicked, which was unpredictable without buying any security.

All state changes are logged to the Security Event Log (SEL).
