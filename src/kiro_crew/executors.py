"""Shared thread-pool executors for blocking maintenance work.

The asyncio event loop's *default* executor is also used by the loop itself
for ``getaddrinfo`` (DNS) and by every ``run_in_executor(None, ...)`` caller.
When long-running maintenance work (orphan-PID sweeps, cron subprocesses,
agent-overlay rewrites) piles onto that default pool it can saturate it and
starve the loop's own DNS resolution -- which is exactly the failure mode that
turns a brief network blip into a multi-second event-loop stall.

This module provides *separate*, bounded pools for that blocking work so it
can never contend with the loop's default executor.

Three pools, deliberately split:

* :func:`maintenance_executor` -- the fast periodic sweeps (orphaned MCP/PID
  cleanup) and agent-overlay rewrites.  These are short and MUST stay
  responsive, because the orphan sweeps are what reap the leaked kiro-cli/MCP
  children whose mass death is the documented root cause of the loop wedge.
* :func:`subprocess_executor` -- per-process teardown work that can block on a
  *wedged kernel resource*: ``os.close`` on a PTY master fd whose far-end shell
  is in uninterruptible sleep, and the ``ps``/``pgrep`` spawns + ``os.kill``
  sweep in :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.client`.  These can hang indefinitely, so they
  get their OWN pool: a storm of wedged teardowns can occupy every worker here
  WITHOUT starving the :func:`maintenance_executor` orphan sweep that is the
  recovery action for the wedge (the bug the wedge fix would otherwise create
  by coupling the recovery mechanism to the same pool as the work that wedges).
* :func:`cron_executor` -- user cron command/script execution, which can run
  for minutes (``job.timeout`` defaults to 300s) and, because the scheduler
  dispatches every due job concurrently, can have several jobs in flight at
  once.  Keeping cron on its OWN pool means a burst of long-running cron jobs
  can never occupy all the maintenance threads and starve the sweeps.
* :func:`discovery_executor` -- browser-triggerable, read-only filesystem
  discovery for dashboard list endpoints (``GET /api/skills``,
  ``/api/agents/installed``, ``/api/prompts``): ``os.walk`` of skill/agent/SOP
  trees, per-file frontmatter reads, edition skill-root globs.  A large catalog
  one such scan take seconds, and a ``run_in_executor`` future cannot be
  cancelled once started, so N concurrent dashboard tabs would each pin a
  worker for the full scan.  This gets its OWN pool so those user-triggerable
  scans can never occupy the :func:`maintenance_executor` workers the orphan
  sweeps need to recover from a wedge.
* :func:`image_executor` -- Pillow decode/resize/encode for the MCP gateway's
  tool-result image budget (:mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.image_budget`).  Paced
  by whatever a brokered MCP server returns, and a single oversized raster
  costs a full decode plus up to seven resize+encode passes -- seconds of CPU.
  Same rationale as :func:`discovery_executor`: externally-paced, seconds-long
  work gets its OWN small pool so a burst of screenshots queues among ITSELF
  and can never occupy the :func:`maintenance_executor` workers the orphan
  sweeps need to recover from a wedge.

Long-term direction: this blocking work should move into a dedicated
supervised process (the VS Code extension-host model), so a wedge there cannot
touch the dashboard event loop at all.  These bounded pools are the in-process
containment until that process split lands.
