"""macOS ``launchd`` backend for pods — the darwin twin of :mod:`kiro_crew.pod.unit`.

The pod runtime's platform-neutral core (name validation, port derivation,
checkout resolution and pinning, env scrubbing, token minting, ``boot``, and the
``cleanup_home`` teardown safety check) is reused unchanged. Only the
service-manager mechanics differ, and they differ in four ways that are worth
knowing before reading the code:

**1. No template units.** systemd installs ONE template
(``kirocrew-pod@.service``) and instantiates it per pod via ``%i``. launchd has
no such concept, so each pod gets its own plist under the pod plane's own directory
(``cfg.pods_dir/dev.kirocrew.pod.<name>.plist`` — deliberately NOT
``~/Library/LaunchAgents``, which launchd loads at login and would resurrect
pods after a reboot; see :func:`plist_path`), written fresh on every
``up``. That is strictly better in one respect: the systemd unit bakes an
absolute ``kirocrew`` path at *install* time, which goes stale when the worktree
it points into is pruned (``unit_exec_ok``'s self-heal exists for exactly that);
re-rendering per ``up`` cannot go stale.

**2. No ``ExecStopPost``.** Neither platform reclaims a pod's isolated HOME from a
post-stop service hook: systemd's would run before the final kill of the unit's
cgroup (racing the pod's own surviving subprocesses) and would also fire on the
stop half of a ``Restart=``, so :func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.stop_pod` owns
reclamation on both. launchd simply never had such a hook, which is why the
consequence was visible here first: a pod whose process dies without an explicit
``down`` (host crash, force-reboot) leaves its isolated HOME behind.
:func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.orphan_homes` exists so ``pod ls`` can REPORT those
(reclaim is `pod down <name>`, run by the user — nothing deletes them
automatically).

**3. No journal.** ``journalctl --user -u <unit>`` has no launchd equivalent, so
the plist routes stdout/stderr to files under the pod artifacts dir and the log
verb tails them. This is a second mechanism, not a variation on unit management.

**4. No cgroups — the resource ceiling is NOT enforced on macOS.** The systemd
unit sets ``MemoryMax=4G`` and ``CPUQuota=200%``: kernel-enforced cgroup ceilings
that the pod documentation advertises as an isolation *guarantee*. macOS has no
cgroups and **no mechanism that bounds the total memory of a process tree or hard
-caps its CPU**. The options were to emit a weaker, non-equivalent bound and risk
it being read as the guarantee, or to state plainly that the ceiling is absent.
This backend does the latter: it emits **no** resource keys at all. Do not
"improve" this by adding ``SoftResourceLimits``/``HardResourceLimits`` and
calling it the 4G cap — ``RLIMIT_AS`` bounds one process's *virtual address
space*, not resident memory and not the subprocess tree, and the gateway spawns
agent subprocesses that each get their own limit, so the total stays unbounded.
(``ProcessType=Background`` would add scheduling de-prioritisation — real but
still not a ceiling. It is deliberately not set here; it is a knob a future
change could add *as* de-prioritisation, never as the cap.)

Every other isolation property is unchanged on macOS: own ``KIROCREW_HOME``, own
derived port, no tunnel, ``--no-crons``, and the refusal to bind the live port.

    Two things here are not obvious and were both found by a real bring-up:

    **``bootout`` is asynchronous.** It returns before launchd has finished
    unloading, so immediately afterwards ``launchctl print`` still resolves the
    label and the gateway process is still alive. Returning at that point makes
    the caller reap the pod's HOME from under a live process — the removal then
    fails silently (``cleanup_home`` uses ``ignore_errors``) while the CLI reports
    zero residue. So poll until the label is really gone.

    **A per-pod plist must not outlive its pod.** systemd's template unit is
    machine-wide and deliberately persists; a launchd plist is per-pod, so leaving
    it behind makes :func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.orphan_homes` classify the leftover HOME as "installed,
    not orphaned" and never collect it, and leaves a stale definition that could be
    bootstrapped later.

    **The unload result must be authoritative.** If the label is STILL loaded
    when the wait expires, this returns a synthetic failure and keeps the plist —
    the caller must not tear down state (the HOME) belonging to a possibly-live
    gateway. A ``bootout`` rc of 3 ("no such process") with the label absent is a
    no-op, not a failure.

    The caller still owns the HOME removal (see ``runtime.stop_pod``) because that
