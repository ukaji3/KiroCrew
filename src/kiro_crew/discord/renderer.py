"""Layer 2b -- Discord ``Renderer`` + interactive approval decider.

``DiscordRenderer`` maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by
the base :class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto Discord's REST API:

* ``on_turn_start`` -- typing indicator loop (Discord's lasts ~10s per trigger).
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- throttled in-place ``edit_message`` streaming, with any
  trailing ``[OPTIONS:]`` markup held back from the visible stream.
* ``on_tool_call`` -- a transient ``🔧 {tool}…`` footer on live frames.
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- Approve/Deny buttons as a SEPARATE message (so
  streaming edits don't clobber them).
* ``on_compaction`` -- a lightweight "compacting…" note.
* ``on_done`` -- the final edit, splitting long output at the capability's
  char cap and attaching the ``[OPTIONS:]`` button rows to the last chunk.

Discord renders standard Markdown natively, so unlike Telegram there is no
HTML translation pass -- the final seal sends the markdown as-is. Steer
rotation (sealing the pre-steer segment and opening a fresh message headed by
a "↪️ steered" chip) mirrors the Telegram renderer.

``DiscordApprovalDecider`` is the interactive ladder's awaiter: ``__call__``
registers a Future keyed by ``session:request_id`` and awaits a button press,
denying by default on timeout; the interaction handler resolves it via
``resolve_global``.

Dependency direction is ``discord -> messaging`` (allowed).
