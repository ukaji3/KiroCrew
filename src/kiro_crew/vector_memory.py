    The separator is stored IN-BAND and unescaped, so the value alone is ambiguous:
    ``A — NOT: B`` is either rule ``A`` with clause ``B``, or a bare rule whose text
    happens to contain the separator. No amount of text parsing settles that -- both
    readings are valid, and picking either one by itself loses data in the other case
    (silently dropping a clause update one way, OVERWRITING an unrelated rule the
    other). Two review rounds demanded exactly opposite behaviour on the same text

    The row itself carries the answer: the key is ``md5(rule)`` taken at write time,
    in the rule's stored casing. So a candidate prefix is the rule only when it
    hashes to this row's key. That is exact rather than heuristic, and it is why
    every separator boundary can be tried safely.

    Rows keyed some other way -- the onboarding import uses sha256, and legacy
    migrations set their own keys -- match only on the whole value. For those a
    case-variant re-submit onto an EXISTING clause will not enrich. That is a missed
    enrichment, never an overwrite: the ambiguous branch always declines. Tracked in
    the follow-up issue together with the storage-format fix.

    Case-insensitivity here is ``lower()``, not ``casefold()`` -- see write_lesson for
    why. ``casefold()``'s ß-to-ss expansion conflates "Maße" with "Masse", which would

        ``defer_embedding`` stores the row with a NULL embedding instead of
        embedding inline, leaving it for :meth:`backfill_missing_embeddings`.
        Inference cost grows steeply with text length (~0.4s per 2000-char chunk
        on CPU), so a bulk writer such as the onboarding importer would hold its
        caller for minutes. The row is FTS5 keyword-searchable immediately, and
        becomes semantically searchable once the sweep fills it in. Only for
        callers that schedule that sweep — a row left NULL forever is silently
        absent from vector search. Deferral also skips the similarity dedup
        (which needs a vector), so the caller keeps its own duplicate check.

        When ``relevance_filter=True``, candidates below the raw-cosine
        relevance gate are dropped BEFORE ranking, so recency cannot order a
        relevant match out of the result. Defaults to False so dashboard/API/CLI
        callers still receive the full ranked set.
        Falls back to FTS5 text search if no embedding provided.

        re-embeds NULL episodic rows in batches and now repairs NULL lesson rows
        alongside them, ``build_faiss_index`` and ``_sqlite_vector_search``
        already skip NULL rows, and FTS keyword search is
        unaffected — so search stays correct (just keyword-only for the affected
        rows) while the re-embed proceeds, and an interrupted run is simply
        resumed by the next sweep.

        The first call on a pre-existing database has no recorded space to compare
        against, and what to do then depends on whether the caller can ATTRIBUTE
        those vectors:

        - ``clear_when_unknown=False`` (default) — the active space is the one
          that produced them (the bundled model), so stamp the signature and
          change nothing. A plain upgrade must not force every user to re-embed
          their whole memory.
        - ``clear_when_unknown=True`` — the caller knows the active space did NOT
          produce them, so they are foreign and get cleared. Callers decide this
          by comparing the active signature against the bundled model's
          (``embeddings.default_embedding_space_signature``), which is provable:
          un-versioned vectors predate custom-model support, so the bundled model
          is the only thing that could have written them. Deciding it that way
          rather than by "is a custom model configured?" covers a model selected
          by config, by env var, or by a programmatic
          ``register_embedding_backend`` alike. Without this the common upgrade
          order — stop, update, point ``embed_model_path`` at a model, start —
          would stamp the NEW signature onto bundled-model vectors and they would
          never be re-embedded.

        A signature that already matches is a no-op regardless of
        ``clear_when_unknown``, so a custom-model host does not re-clear on
        every boot.

        Entries written while the embedding model was still downloading (first

        with ``write_episodic(defer_embedding=True)`` by a bulk writer such as
        the onboarding importer. Once the model is present and ``embed_fn`` is
        bound, this sweep embeds those rows and rebuilds the vector index so they
        become semantically searchable.

        Rows cleared by :meth:`reconcile_embedding_space` after an embedding-model
        change arrive here the same way, so a model swap re-embeds through this
        one path rather than a parallel one. Lesson vectors cleared by the same
