"""Run-marker so remote token-mint targets the *running* gateway's install.

The problem this solves:
    Token mint SSHes to the remote desktop and runs ``kirocrew token`` resolved
    from a fixed PATH candidate list (:data:`token_mint.REMOTE_BIN_CANDIDATES`,
    first entry ``$HOME/.local/bin/kirocrew``). When that launcher symlinks into
    an *uninstalled* git worktree (no ``.venv``), every mint fails with
    "KiroCrew venv not found" — even though the gateway itself is up and healthy,
    because it runs from a *different* venv. The user's sync -> rebuild -> restart
    of the gateway can't fix mint, since mint never consults the gateway's own
    install. The proactive/reactive token-refresh loop then re-mints on every
    poll and fails, which surfaces as the pane periodically disconnecting and
    reconnecting.

The fix:
    At startup the gateway records the absolute path to *its own* ``kirocrew``
    launcher, keyed by the port it serves, at
    ``<config_dir>/run/gateway-<port>.bin``. The mint shell snippet reads that
    marker first and, when it names an executable, ``exec``s it — guaranteeing
    mint uses the same built venv as the live gateway. An absent/stale marker
    (older remotes, or a gateway that isn't running) makes mint fall back to the
    candidate search, so nothing regresses.

Trust: the marker lives in the ``0700`` ``run/`` dir (owner-only) and is written
``0600`` by the gateway itself; the dir is on the ``is_sensitive_path`` floor
(``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``) so agent file tools cannot write it. That
write boundary — not an ownership check on the mint side — is what bounds who can
plant a marker; the mint side additionally only ``exec``s the path when it is an
executable file (``-x``), the same boundary as the pre-existing
``~/.local/bin/kirocrew`` candidate.

Second consumer — port discovery:
    The marker's *filename* also advertises which port a gateway is serving, so
    :func:`marker_ports` lets a local client command (``token`` / ``status`` /
    ``logout`` / ``stop``, via ``port_resolution.resolve_client_port``) find a gateway
    on a non-default port with zero configuration. That path reads only the
    filename, never the recorded launcher path.

    A marker is NOT proof a gateway is there: :func:`clear_marker` runs only on
    graceful shutdown, so a crash or SIGKILL leaves the file behind and an
    unrelated process may since have bound that port. Because client commands
    send the local secret (``X-Local-Secret``) to whatever is listening, the
    consumer MUST verify the listener before trusting a discovered port, using
    the pid sidecar this module writes beside the marker (:func:`read_pid`) — see
    ``port_resolution._gateway_owns_port``. This module deliberately does not offer a
    bare "is something listening" helper, so no caller can mistake reachability
    for identity.

    Stale markers accumulate one per port ever used, and each one costs a client

    is current, and it is the only writer.

    What it must NOT reap is a sibling that is still serving. ``gateway.lock``
    makes a gateway a singleton per data home only when every start goes through
    it; in practice one machine runs several -- a second gateway launched by hand,
    one started from another checkout that inherits the default data home, a
    cutover overlapping its predecessor -- and those really do share a home. A
    blanket prune then deletes a LIVE gateway's marker and pid sidecar, which
    makes it undiscoverable to `token` / `status` / `stop` and removes the very
    evidence the credential writer uses to avoid clobbering that gateway's
    credential. So each candidate is checked against the same ownership proof its
    readers use (recorded pid, holds the port, same uid, argv looks like a
    gateway) and skipped when it passes.

    Best-effort and never raises: a marker we fail to remove only costs a future

    It removes the marker and pid sidecar but NEVER the credential, because
    ``_gateway_owns_port`` cannot tell a dead gateway from an unprovable one. It
    fails closed by RETURNING FALSE -- non-POSIX returns False outright, and a
    missing or throwing listener-lookup tool is folded into False as well -- so
    False means "ownership not proven", not "process gone". Deleting on False
    would therefore delete a LIVE incumbent's credential on every Windows host
    and on any host without listener tooling; its clients would fall back to the
    shared ``.local_secret`` that a newcomer may have replaced, and the prune
    would CAUSE the 403 the per-port credential exists to prevent.

    A credential left behind is the safe residue: it is only reachable for a port
