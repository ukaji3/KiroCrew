"""Mint a remote KiroCrew dashboard token over SSH.

Build the shell snippet that runs ``kirocrew token`` on the remote desktop and
parse the JWT out of the URL it prints. Lifting this into the gateway lets the
``SshTunnelManager`` (Stage 4) mint a per-instance token at connect time without
reinventing the bin-candidate search.

Security (standard practices):

* The minted token is a short-lived (≤20h) bearer credential. It is **never
  logged** and is returned only to the in-memory caller.
* ``ssh`` is invoked via ``create_subprocess_exec`` with an argv list (no shell
  on the *local* side), so ``ssh_host`` cannot inject local shell syntax.
* The *remote* command is necessarily a single string the remote shell runs.
  Its only variable parts are the candidate bin paths (hard-coded literals), a
  user ``remote_bin`` (charset-validated by the registry / tunnel manager before
  reaching here), and ``ttl`` (validated by :func:`_validate_ttl`).

    data home and ``exec``s the first launcher it names that is an executable
    file:

    1. ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` — an explicit override, if exported into this shell.
    2. ``$HOME/<CONFIG_DIR_NAME>`` — the current default data home.
    3. ``$HOME/<LEGACY_CONFIG_DIR_NAME>`` — the pre-move legacy home (older remotes).

    The default/legacy home segments are **interpolated from**
    :data:`kiro_crew.config.paths.CONFIG_DIR_NAME` /
    :data:`~kiro_crew.config.paths.LEGACY_CONFIG_DIR_NAME` — the same constants
    ``config_dir()`` (the marker *writer*) derives its default from — so reader

    sides from that single edit instead of leaving these shell literals to drift
    stale (which is precisely the read/write desync this whole mechanism guards).

    ``$HOME``/``$KIROCREW_HOME`` expand at remote-shell parse time; *port* is a
    bounded int (see :func:`_validate_port`) and the home segments are trusted
    module constants, so the path literals cannot inject shell syntax.

    Why the multi-home probe: the writer keys the marker off the gateway
    process's ``config_dir()``, which now defaults to ``~/.kiro/crew`` after the
    ``~/.kirocrew`` -> ``~/.kiro/crew`` data-home move. This prelude runs in the
    *remote* non-interactive SSH shell, which usually does NOT export
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` — so a single ``${KIROCREW_HOME:-$HOME/.kirocrew}`` default
    (the pre-move literal) would read the wrong, now-empty legacy path on every
    migrated remote, miss the marker, and fall through to the blind candidate
    search (which lands on whatever ``~/.local/bin/kirocrew`` points at, e.g. an
    uninstalled worktree). Probing both the new default and the legacy home — and
    still honoring an explicit ``KIROCREW_HOME`` above both — restores the marker
    hit on migrated remotes while remaining a no-op on un-migrated ones. Falls
    through to the candidate search when no marker names an executable, so

    back as ``<no stderr>`` and the operator had to SSH in to learn why. Carrying
    a stdout tail makes the real reason travel with the exception.

    Why stripping is mandatory: unlike stderr, stdout is the one stream that
    *does* carry the minted JWT on success. This tail is only ever built on a
    failure path, but a partially-successful remote (URL printed, then a
    non-zero exit) could still put a live credential in it — so the token is
    substituted out FIRST, before the generic credential/exfil redactors run,
    and the result is truncated to the last *limit* chars (the tail, because the
    reason is the last thing printed).

    Why the scan is bounded: the scrubbers cost ~1s per MB of stdout and `re`
    holds the GIL, so scanning an unbounded remote payload stalls the gateway's
    event loop (13s measured on 13MB). Only the last ``_OUTPUT_SCAN_CHARS`` are
