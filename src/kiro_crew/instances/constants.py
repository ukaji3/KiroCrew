"""Tunable constants for the Instances feature.

Isolated in this module so resource limits and defaults can be adjusted in one
place without hunting through the registry / tunnel-manager code.

These values are the *defaults* for the corresponding ``InstancesConfig`` fields
in ``kiro_crew.config.loader``; a user can override them via
``kirocrew config set instances.<key> <value>``. Keeping the canonical default
here (and referencing it from the dataclass) means the constant and the config
default can never drift apart.

# JS/HTML/JSON — highly compressible (typically 3-5x), and the gateway does not
# gzip its HTTP responses, so nothing is double-compressed. Default on because
# the dominant deployment is a dedicated remote gateway host where spare CPU to

# needs only a TCP handshake, so 15s is generous for most hosts. However, hosts
# behind a ProxyCommand (jump host, WSSH, corporate proxy) routinely spend
# 12-16s on the proxy handshake alone before ssh even begins the forward, so

# Cap on the ssh ConnectTimeout the diagnostics probes (_probe_ssh,

# to take — a diagnosis is a different use case with its own UX budget: a user
# who tuned connect_timeout_secs up to, say, 90s for a genuinely slow proxy

DIAGNOSTICS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_CAP_SECS: float = 15.0

# How long (secs) to wait for the remote `kirocrew token` to return before

# Timeout (secs) for the loopback liveness probe that validates a *stored* token
# before the API hands it to the browser on (re)connect. A stored token can go
# stale while the tunnel stays CONNECTED (a failed self-heal re-mint, or a remote
# `kirocrew restart` that invalidates tokens); an iframe loaded with a stale
# token gets a server-rendered 403 page, so the SPA never boots to fire the
# reactive `mc-auth-expired` recovery. The probe (GET /api/status?token=... over
# the existing tunnel — no SSH) closes that initial-load gap. It is
# deny-by-default: anything but a positive 2xx (including a timeout/connection
# error) is treated as invalid and forces a fresh mint; if that mint also fails
# the link is genuinely down and the caller returns an error rather than serving
# an unconfirmed token. Kept tight so a tab activation never blocks perceptibly.

# capped at ~20 MB of message content, and the SSH forward it crosses can be a
# high-latency link, so a probe-sized budget would fail every large transfer. The
# request is still bounded rather than unlimited, so an unresponsive peer
# surfaces as a clean transfer error instead of hanging the caller's turn.
DEFAULT_SESSION_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT_SECS: float = 30.0

# Timeout (secs) for one federated session-search request over an already-open
# tunnel (GET the peer's /api/sessions/search — no SSH spawn). Sized between the
# token probe (2s, a bare status ping) and the transfer (30s, a ~20 MB bundle):
# a search reply is a small JSON page but the peer does real scanning work
# (bounded by its own _SEARCH_SCAN_WINDOW), so the probe budget would produce
# false "unreachable" verdicts on a loaded peer, while anything transfer-sized
# would let one dead tunnel stall an interactive, keystroke-driven search. The
# fan-out runs peers concurrently, so this is also the worst-case latency a
# slow peer adds to the aggregated response.
DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECS: float = 6.0

# Byte ceiling for one peer's federated-search reply, enforced BEFORE JSON
# decoding (resp.json() buffers the whole body first, so a hostile/broken peer
# streaming an unbounded reply could exhaust hub memory before any per-field
# clamp runs). Sized generously above any honest reply: the aggregator caps
# limit at 200 rows and every string field is clamped to 2 KiB downstream, so
# a truthful worst case is well under 1 MiB; 4 MiB only ever bites on garbage.

# that spend it. A value one layer accepts and another rejects is stored happily
# and then fails at the next connect, blaming the tunnel for a bad edit.
#
# Anchored with ``\Z`` rather than ``$``: Python's ``$`` also matches just BEFORE
