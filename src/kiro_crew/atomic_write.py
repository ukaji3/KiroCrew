    Atomic replacement is the last step of every tmp-file-plus-rename writer. On
    Windows that rename fails with ``PermissionError`` if any other handle is
    open on either path. An indexer or an AV scanner touching the freshly
    written temp file is enough, so a correct atomic write can still lose its
    payload for reasons unrelated to the caller. Retry a bounded number of times
    so the transient resolves instead of propagating.

    On POSIX this is a plain ``os.replace``: the OS permits replacing an open
    file, so a ``PermissionError`` means the caller genuinely cannot write there
    and is re-raised immediately rather than slept over.

    The retry sleeps, so it is gated on there being no running event loop in
    this thread. A caller reached from the gateway loop gets the plain
    ``os.replace`` semantics it had before this retry existed: the
    ``PermissionError`` propagates on the first attempt rather than pausing the
    single loop for the whole budget (``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``). This
    is a property of this function, so it holds no matter how many sync helpers
    sit between a coroutine and this call. Callers wanting the retry on a
    loop-driven path offload the write (``asyncio.to_thread`` /
    ``run_in_executor``), as ``AutoNudgeService`` already does; the worker has no
    loop of its own, so the retry applies there.

    The final attempt sits OUTSIDE the retry loop on purpose. With it inside,
    a budget of 0 would skip the body entirely and return having renamed
    nothing, which every caller reads as success: a silently lost write. Out
    here, any budget of 1 or less simply degrades to a plain ``os.replace``.

    Uses ``tempfile.mkstemp`` so concurrent writers never collide on the
    same temp filename.  On error the temp file is cleaned up.

    *content* may be ``str`` (written UTF-8 encoded in text mode) or ``bytes``
    (written verbatim in binary mode). Binary mode exists for callers whose
    payload is not text at all — a compiled helper binary, an archive — which
    previously had to hand-roll the temp-write-and-rename and so silently
    missed the Windows rename retry above.

    *mode* sets explicit permissions (e.g. ``0o600`` for secrets).
    ``None`` (default) applies umask-based permissions (matching ``open()``).

    *newline* is passed straight to ``open()``. The default (``None``) applies
    universal-newline translation, which rewrites ``\\n`` to ``\\r\\n`` on
    Windows. Pass ``""`` when the content must land on disk byte-for-byte —
    e.g. a document that is read back, edited and saved again, where
    translation on every save would accumulate carriage returns. It is
    meaningless for ``bytes`` content, which is never translated, so passing
    both raises rather than silently ignoring the argument.

    *restrict_to_owner* locks the file down to its owner for secret-bearing
    payloads (credentials, HMAC keys, tokens). It is NOT the same as
    ``mode=0o600``: ``fchmod_safe`` is a documented no-op on Windows, so
    ``mode`` alone leaves a Windows temp readable at its inherited DACL for the
    whole write. This applies
    :func:`platform_compat.restrict_to_owner` to the temp file BEFORE any
    content reaches it — the ordering the hand-rolled sites already use — so
    the secret never exists in a world-readable file. It also implies
    ``0o600`` on POSIX, hence the conflict check below: passing a wider
    explicit *mode* alongside it is a caller bug, and narrowing it silently
    would hide that.

    *restrict_on_error* selects what happens when that lockdown fails, and only
    means anything alongside ``restrict_to_owner=True``. The default ``"raise"``
    refuses to write a secret it cannot protect. ``"warn"`` logs and writes
    anyway, for the callers whose own comments say the write matters more than
    the permissions: ``sel.py`` must not brick SecurityEventLog init on a
    read-only filesystem, and ``dashboard/refresh_tokens.py`` must not drop
    refresh-token reuse-detection state. Note the asymmetry the two platforms
    give ``"warn"``: on POSIX ``restrict_to_owner`` is ``chmod(0o600)``, which
    the ``fchmod_safe`` below repeats, so the file still lands at ``0o600``
    after a warn; on Windows ``fchmod_safe`` is a no-op, so a warn genuinely
    publishes the file under its inherited ACL. That is the exposure those
    callers accept today, stated rather than implied.
