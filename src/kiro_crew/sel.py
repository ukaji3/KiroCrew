"""Security Event Log — immutable, tamper-evident audit trail for tool invocations.

Records structured JSON events for every tool/MCP action with:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 UTC)
- Caller identity (session key, agent, source interface)
- Operation type (tool_call, tool_approved, tool_rejected, tool_denied, mcp_call)
- Resources affected (tool name, tool kind, arguments summary)
- Outcome (approved, rejected, denied, completed, failed)
- Downstream service (MCP server name if applicable)
- HMAC-SHA256 integrity chain (each entry signs over previous hash)

Storage: ``<config_dir>/security_events.jsonl`` (append-only JSONL); the HMAC
signing key lives OUTSIDE the log directory in ``<config_dir>/trust/`` so an
actor who can rewrite the log dir cannot also read the key and re-sign a
clean-looking chain.
Retention: configurable, default 365 days per Amazon Security Event Logging Standard.

    accessor: the FILE must be preferred and this used only as a fallback. A
    readable file is the anchor every OTHER process resolves independently, so a
    second caller that reached for memory first would sign MACs a separate
    verifier rejects. Keeping one caller keeps that rule enforceable.

    ``SecurityEventLog`` reads the key once at init and signs every subsequent
    record from that in-memory copy, so the audit chain is immune to the key
    file moving, being deleted, losing read permission, or being truncated
    afterwards. The dependent protocol that re-reads the file on every use is
    not, and its resolved path is never re-resolved — which is how a gateway
    ends up publishing unsigned identities forever while its audit chain still
    looks healthy. These are the same bytes, already validated at init
    (``>= _HMAC_KEY_MIN_BYTES``, see ``_load_or_create_hmac_key``).

    Returns ``None`` when no initialized singleton exists in this process (the
    verifying MCP process, typically) or the cached key is unusable.
