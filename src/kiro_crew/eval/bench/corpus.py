"""The neutral corpus contract every memory benchmark normalizes into.

Why a contract instead of two bespoke runners: LongMemEval and LoCoMo disagree
on almost every surface detail — LongMemEval is a JSON array of 500 instances
each owning its own haystack and exactly one question, while LoCoMo is 10
conversations that each carry ~199 questions against one shared haystack whose
sessions are *string-keyed siblings* of a flat dict rather than a list. Scoring
also differs in kind: LongMemEval's official metric is an LLM judge with five
different prompts selected by question type, LoCoMo's is token-level F1 computed
differently per category with one category not scored by F1 at all.

None of that variance belongs in the ruler. The ruler asks one question — did
the memory layer surface the evidence the question needed — and that question is
identical for both datasets once the corpus is expressed as *instances*, each
holding a haystack of sessions and a set of queries with gold evidence ids. The
per-dataset weirdness is confined to the adapters, and the per-dataset scoring is
confined to the scorers.

Shape note that drives everything downstream: one instance == one memory store.
LongMemEval's ``longmemeval_s`` runs ~40 sessions per instance across 500
instances; pouring all of that into a single store would blow through
``episodic_max`` (10 000) and start tombstoning by ``importance ASC, created_at
ASC``, silently deleting the very evidence being scored. Instances are therefore
independent measurement units, never merged.

Everything here is frozen and hashable so a corpus can be fingerprinted and a
run's inputs pinned in the report.

    """One utterance in a haystack session.

    ``turn_id`` is the join key for turn-level recall and must be unique within
    the instance. LoCoMo supplies one natively (``dia_id``, e.g. ``"D1:9"``);
    LongMemEval has no turn id at all, so its adapter synthesizes one from the
    session id and the turn's index. Treat it as opaque — LongMemEval's session
    ids carry an ``answer_`` prefix on evidence sessions, and parsing structure
    out of that would leak the label into the ranking.

    ``speaker`` is deliberately a free string rather than a role enum: LongMemEval
    uses ``user``/``assistant``, LoCoMo uses the participants' actual names.

    ``timestamp`` is the dataset's raw string, unparsed and unnormalized. The two
    datasets use different formats (``"2023/04/10 (Mon) 23:07"`` vs ``"1:56 pm on
    8 May, 2023"``); parsing is the ingester's job because only it knows whether
    the run wants real dates or not.

    ``is_evidence`` is turn-level ground truth where the dataset states it
    directly (LongMemEval's ``has_answer``). It is NOT the same thing as being in
    some query's gold set — a turn can be marked evidence for a question that
    this instance's query list does not contain. Scoring joins on the query's
    ``gold_turn_ids``; this field is retained for corpus diagnostics only.

      ``answer`` key at all — 444 of 1 986 items.
    * LongMemEval's ``single-session-preference`` items put a *prose rubric* in
      ``answer`` ("The user would prefer responses that suggest resources
      specifically tailored to Adobe Premiere Pro…"), which the official judge
      feeds in under a ``Rubric:`` header rather than as a correct answer.
    * LongMemEval's abstention items put an *explanation of unanswerability* in
      ``answer``, fed to the judge under an ``Explanation:`` header.

    ``unanswerable`` marks that third family plus LoCoMo's adversarial items: the
    correct behavior is refusal, so a scorer that rewards recall would reward
    exactly the wrong thing. Note LongMemEval does not expose abstention as a
    ``question_type`` — it is a ``_abs`` suffix on ``question_id``.

    ``gold_session_ids`` / ``gold_turn_ids`` are the evidence sets the retrieval
    ruler scores against. Either may be empty: 4 LoCoMo items ship an empty
    evidence list, and 7 of its 2 815 evidence refs are dangling (they name a
    ``dia_id`` present in no conversation). Queries with no resolvable gold are
