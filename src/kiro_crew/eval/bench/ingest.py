"""Load a benchmark corpus into a real ``VectorMemoryStore``.

This is the seam where the benchmark stops being a dataset and starts being a
measurement of Kiro Crew. Everything here is deliberate about one thing: the store
under test is the production store, unmodified, with production defaults, and
every knob that could move a score is an explicit recorded field rather than a
hidden default. Memory-benchmark numbers are dominated by answer model, judge and
*ingestion granularity*; a harness that leaves granularity implicit produces a
number nobody can reproduce or compare.

Three properties of the real store shape this module, and each one is a trap that
would silently corrupt a score if ignored.

**1. The embedder loads in the background and returns ``None`` until resident.**
``make_sync_embed_fn`` never blocks (embeddings.py) — callers get ``None`` while
the model is still loading. A harness that starts writing immediately would store
rows with NULL embeddings, degrade ``search_episodic`` to its FTS5 ``LIKE``
keyword fallback, and report a "retrieval score" that measured substring matching.
:func:`prepare_embedder` therefore blocks on ``wait_ready`` and refuses to ingest
without a working vector, rather than proceeding into a meaningless run.

**2. Retrieval scoring applies a recency decay of ``exp(-0.03 * days_old)``.**
This interacts violently with dated corpora. LoCoMo's sessions are stamped in
2023; backdated literally, ``days_old`` is ~1100 and the decay factor is ~4e-15 —
every score underflows toward zero and ranking collapses into float noise. Worse,
sessions *within* one LoCoMo conversation are months apart, so even without
underflow a 300-day-older session carries a 1.2e-4 relative penalty that dwarfs
any cosine difference: retrieval degenerates into "return the newest session".
That is a real property of the store, not a bug in the benchmark, so it is
surfaced rather than hidden — see :class:`Timeline` for the three modes and what
each one is good for.

**3. Dedup at cosine 0.88 can delete gold turns.** LoCoMo is full of near-identical
pleasantries ("Hey! Good to see you!"). The store tombstones near-duplicates, and
some of those are evidence turns for some question. Measuring with dedup ON is the
faithful choice — it is what a real user's memory does — but it puts a ceiling on
achievable recall that has nothing to do with ranking quality. So every dropped
fragment is counted and reported: an unreachable ceiling that is visible is a
finding, an unreachable ceiling that is silent is a wrong number.

    """Every input that can move a score, in one recordable object.

    ``granularity`` — ``"turn"`` writes one episodic fragment per utterance,
    ``"session"`` writes one per session (the whole transcript concatenated).
    Turn-level is the default because it is the only granularity at which
    turn-level recall means anything, and because it is the harder, more honest
    retrieval task: the store must find one utterance among thousands rather than
    one document among forty. Note that NEITHER matches what production
    consolidation writes — production writes LLM-summarized fragments. That
    difference is the whole reason :mod:`.pipeline` exists as a separate mode.

    ``timeline`` — see the module docstring. ``"anchored"`` preserves the corpus's
    relative time structure while placing its most recent session at "now", which
    exercises the decay term the way a real user's memory would without the
    absolute-age underflow that ``"literal"`` produces on a 2023 corpus.
    ``"now"`` flattens every fragment to the same instant, making the decay factor
    a constant and thereby isolating pure semantic ranking — the right mode for
    attributing a retrieval change to embedding/ranking rather than to recency.

    ``dedup_threshold`` defaults to the store's own production value. It is
    exposed, not hidden, because dedup can silently eat gold turns. Two caveats
    that took a real run to establish, and that bound what raising it can buy you:

    * ``write_episodic`` *also* rejects any text whose lowercased first 80
      characters already exist (``LOWER(SUBSTR(text, 1, 80))``), unconditionally
      and without consulting this threshold at all. Byte-identical fragments are
      therefore always dropped, at any threshold.
    * the cosine near-duplicate check is gated on a live FAISS index
      (``self._faiss_index.ntotal > 0``), so on a host where ``faiss`` is not
      importable this threshold is **inert in both directions** — near-duplicates
      are never rejected, and raising it changes nothing.

    So raising it above 1.0 disables *near*-duplicate rejection only, and only
    where FAISS is present.

    ``speaker_prefix`` — LoCoMo's speaker is a person's name and many of its
    questions are about *who* said or did something, so dropping the attribution
    would make a whole category unanswerable for reasons unrelated to memory.
