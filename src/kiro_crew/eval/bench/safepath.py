"""One filesystem guard for every caller-influenced path in the benchmark harness.

Why a shared helper rather than a check at each call site: the first two rounds of
review on this code found the same class of hole twice, in mirror image. Round one
gated the report *read* (``bench compare <path>``); round two found the report
*write* (``--out-dir`` + ``--stem``) still ungated, which is strictly worse — a read
discloses, a write destroys. Fixing that one site would have left three more:
``--out-dir``'s ``mkdir``, and the corpus cache root, which ``KIROCREW_BENCH_CACHE``
can point anywhere. Point-wise patching is how the second hole survived the first
fix, so the guard lives in one place and every argv- or env-influenced path calls it.

The threat model is the same one that justifies the read gate. These values arrive
from argv and the environment, and in this product neither is necessarily set by the
human who owns the machine: an agent can run any CLI command. So

    kirocrew bench retrieval --out-dir ~/.kiro/crew --stem security_policy

is a reachable invocation that would overwrite a governance policy file with a
benchmark report. Nothing about the benchmark needs to write there, so it is refused
rather than made careful.

Write protection is deliberately stricter than read protection. ``is_sensitive_path``
answers "is this path inside a protected location"; for a directory that is about to
receive files, the question is also "does a protected location lie *under* it", which
is what ``path_contains_sensitive`` answers. A ``--out-dir`` of ``~`` is not itself
sensitive, but writing a tree there is not something this command should do.

# printing a credential file to stdout — and writing through one truncates whatever
# it points at.
#
# Anything that can plant that link is anything running as this user, which by this
# harness's own threat model includes an agent. And resolving the name then opening
# the name leaves a window in which the final component can be swapped between the
# two, so the guard has to be paired with an open that refuses to follow a link

    Creates a NEW file and nothing else. ``O_EXCL`` is the load-bearing flag: creation
    is atomic, so a name that already holds a file, a symlink, a hardlink alias or a
    directory fails with ``EEXIST`` and is refused rather than written through. That is
    what makes this safe where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist — see below — and it is
    also why nothing here truncates: there is never anything to truncate.

    A caller that needs to REPLACE an existing file wants
    :func:`write_text_atomic_nofollow`, which publishes by rename. This one is for
    the temporary files a rename publishes from, and for artifacts written once.

    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (where it exists) fails with ``ELOOP`` when the final component is
    a link, which makes the refusal specific rather than a bare ``EEXIST``.

    Returns a raw fd; wrap it with :func:`os.fdopen`. Mode is 0o600 because a corpus
    cache file has no reason to be group- or world-readable.

    Note which path is opened: the guard resolves in order to answer "does this name
    mean somewhere protected", but the ``open`` must use the path **as given**, not the
    resolved one. Opening the resolved path makes ``O_NOFOLLOW`` a no-op -- resolution
    has already followed the link, so the flag inspects the target's final component
    instead of the link, and the write lands on the redirect exactly as if there were
    no flag at all. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` only covers the final component; ancestor
    directories are covered by guarding the containing root.

    **Windows has no ``O_NOFOLLOW``.** ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)`` returns 0
    there, so the flag contributes nothing and ``O_EXCL`` carries the protection
    instead. An earlier version relied on an ``is_symlink()`` pre-check and then
    opened the name for writing, which refused a link that was already there and
    followed one planted between the check and the open -- a window a reviewer was
    right to call a defect rather than a documented limit. Exclusive creation has no
    such window on any platform, because there is no moment at which an existing name
    is opened at all. The ``is_symlink()`` check is kept only so the refusal says
    "this is a symbolic link" instead of "something exists here".

    A ctypes ``CreateFileW`` with ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` is no longer worth
    considering here: it would buy the same property exclusive creation already has,
    at the price of security code that cannot be exercised on the machine this

    Round 16 put the re-validation in the pinned branch and left the fallback reading
    the verdict of a resolution taken earlier -- the same rule, applied at one of two
    sites, which is the defect class this module keeps having to close. Both branches
    now re-check.

    Two things happen here, and only the first is available on the pinned path:

    1. the composed destination is re-validated against the CURRENT resolution, so a
       retargeted ancestor cannot inherit a verdict given before it moved;
    2. any reparse point (symlink, or a Windows junction, which ``islink`` does not
       report) in the ancestor chain is refused outright.

    (2) exists because a descriptor cannot be held here. A link in the chain is the
    component an attacker retargets, so where the write cannot be pinned to an inode,
    the presence of that component is refused instead. The cost is honest: an
    ``--out-dir`` reached through a junction is rejected on Windows and the message
    says so. The alternative -- refusing every write on the platform, which is what a
    literal "fail closed when the parent cannot be pinned" would mean -- withdraws the
    command from Windows entirely, and that is a bigger claim than the threat needs.

    What remains: an attacker who creates a reparse point in the chain in the window
    between this scan and the write still wins. That window is microseconds and needs
    the attacker to already be able to replace a directory component of the caller's
    own output path; before this, retargeting a junction at ANY point during the run
    was enough.
