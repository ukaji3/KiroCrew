"""Paired A/B comparison for benchmark metrics.

The statistical protocol is lifted from ``auto_improvement/spine/measurer.py``,
which is the one place in this repo that already gets measurement discipline
right: warmups discarded, at least two reps, **median never mean**, arms measured
**interleaved** so host drift cancels in the paired delta, and a mandatory
sensitivity check that must clear the noise band before any result is believed.
What is not reusable is its code — it is shaped around a ``Proposal`` carrying a
git worktree, and its metric is a duration to be *minimized*. Here the metric is a
quality score in [0, 1] to be *maximized*, and the arms are two configurations or
two commits, not two worktrees. So the protocol is reused and the plumbing is not.

One adaptation matters more than the rest. The retrieval ruler is **deterministic**
— local embedder, deterministic ranker, no sampling — so its delta is exact and a
single rep is not an approximation of the truth, it *is* the truth. Running reps
against it would produce identical numbers and a spread of zero, which reads as
false precision. The end-to-end answer scorers are the opposite: Kiro Crew threads
no ``temperature`` or ``seed`` through its provider stack, so those scores are
random variables and a delta smaller than the noise band means nothing.

Conflating the two is how a harness starts reporting confidence it has not earned,
so :class:`ArmResult` carries ``deterministic`` and the comparison refuses to
attach a noise band to an exact number, or to omit one from a noisy one.
