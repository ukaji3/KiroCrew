"""Fetch-on-demand acquisition for the external benchmark corpora.

Nothing here is vendored into the repo. The reason is size, not licensing: the
LongMemEval variant that can actually measure retrieval is 277 MB, and its
sibling ``_m`` variant is 2.7 GB. Committing either would dominate the repository
and every clone of it. LoCoMo's 2.7 MB would be tolerable, but a benchmark
harness with one vendored corpus and one fetched corpus has two code paths where
one will do, so both are fetched.

Both sources are ungated and need no token — verified against the live
endpoints. Downloads are pinned to immutable upstream revisions (a git commit for
LoCoMo, a repo revision hash for the HuggingFace dataset) rather than a moving
``main``, because a corpus that changes underneath a stored baseline turns a
regression into a mystery.

Integrity has two tiers, and the distinction is reported rather than blurred:

* **Pinned upstream** — the expected SHA-256 is hardcoded below because the file
  was downloaded and hashed when this module was written. A mismatch is a hard
  error.
* **Pinned on first fetch** — no hardcoded hash (the file is too large to have
  been fetched during development). The first successful download writes a
  sidecar ``.sha256``; every later fetch is checked against it. This catches
  upstream drift from the second run onward, and says so plainly instead of
  claiming an integrity guarantee it does not have.
