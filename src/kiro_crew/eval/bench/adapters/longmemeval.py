"""LongMemEval → neutral corpus.

Shape, verified empirically against the cleaned ``longmemeval_oracle.json``
rather than against the upstream README (which is wrong on ``has_answer``, see
below): the file is a JSON **array** of 500 objects, each carrying its own
haystack and exactly one question. That one-question-per-instance shape is the
mirror image of LoCoMo's ~199-questions-per-instance, and it is why LongMemEval's
ingest cost per scored question is two orders of magnitude higher — every
question pays for its own store.

Three traps are handled here explicitly because each one silently produces a
*plausible* number if you get it wrong:

1. **``has_answer`` is always present.** The README says it appears only on
   evidence turns; in the cleaned file all 10 960 turns carry it as an explicit
   bool (896 true / 10 064 false). Presence therefore means nothing — only the
   value does. Read defensively with ``.get`` so an older or uncleaned dump still
   loads, but never infer evidence from the key existing.

2. **Abstention is not a ``question_type``.** The six types are
   ``temporal-reasoning`` (133), ``multi-session`` (133), ``knowledge-update``
   (78), ``single-session-user`` (70), ``single-session-assistant`` (56),
   ``single-session-preference`` (30). The 30 abstention items are marked by an
   ``_abs`` suffix on ``question_id`` and *also* carry one of those six types, so
   a reader that looks for an abstention category finds none and scores refusal
   questions as ordinary recall questions.

3. **Evidence sessions are named ``answer_…``.** That prefix is a label leak: any
   ranking, chunking or gold-resolution step that keys off it would score the
   dataset's naming convention instead of the memory layer. Gold comes from
   ``answer_session_ids`` and from ``has_answer`` — never from the id's spelling.
   Nothing in this module inspects the prefix.

``answer`` is not a string to match against. It has three unrelated families:
a factual answer for most types, a *prose rubric* for
``single-session-preference`` (the official judge feeds it under a ``Rubric:``
header), and an *explanation of why the question is unanswerable* for ``_abs``
items (fed under an ``Explanation:`` header). The adapter only carries it in
``gold_answer``; deciding what to do with it is the scorer's job, and anyone
tempted to write ``==`` against it should read this paragraph first.
