"""LoCoMo → the neutral corpus contract.

Why this file is longer than "read JSON, build dataclasses": LoCoMo's on-disk
shape disagrees with its own paper and with every intuition about how a
multi-session dialogue dataset would be laid out, and three of those
disagreements silently corrupt the measurement rather than raising.

* ``conversation`` is a FLAT DICT. Sessions are string-keyed siblings
  (``session_1``, ``session_1_date_time``, ``session_2``, …) of the two speaker
  names, not a list. So session discovery is key-pattern matching, and ordering
  has to be numeric — a lexical sort puts ``session_10`` before ``session_2``
  and scrambles the only temporal signal the haystack has.
* ``conv-26`` carries ``session_20_date_time`` … ``session_35_date_time`` with no
  matching ``session_N`` list. Deriving the session list from the timestamp keys
  yields 16 phantom empty sessions on that one conversation, which inflates
  session-level denominators for a reason that has nothing to do with the
  memory layer. Discovery therefore keys off ``session_N`` presence and looks the
  date up with ``.get()``.
* ``answer`` is ABSENT on the 444 adversarial items (category 5), so
  ``q['answer']`` raises on 22% of the corpus. Two items carry both ``answer``
  and ``adversarial_answer``; both are kept.

Session membership is derived from *which session list a turn appeared in*, never
from parsing the ``dia_id``. The id happens to look like ``D<session>:<turn>``,
but the file is the authority on membership and the string is treated as opaque —
the same discipline ``corpus.BenchTurn`` documents for LongMemEval's
``answer_``-prefixed session ids, and for the same reason: structure parsed out
of an id is structure that can be wrong without anyone noticing.

Dangling evidence refs (7 of 2 815 name a ``dia_id`` present in no conversation)
are passed straight through and dropped by ``BenchInstance.resolve_gold()``,
which this loader calls before returning. Filtering them here would hide from the
report the fact that the dataset shipped them; ``resolve_gold`` is the one place
that owns "gold that names nothing in this haystack".
