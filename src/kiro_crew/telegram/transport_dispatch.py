"""Full new-path dispatch: TelegramTransport -> TurnDriver -> TelegramRenderer.

``TelegramTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound update and
hands the ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`TelegramDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the Slack transport dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact, /model, /yolo, /help)
    -> construct TelegramRenderer + on_turn_start (immediate ack placeholder)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft-threshold notice)  # each guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

``on_callback`` resolves interactive tool approvals (``a:<rid>:<1|0>`` ->
``TelegramApprovalDecider.resolve_global``), applies ``/model`` picks
(``m:<index>``) and re-injects ``[OPTIONS:]`` choices (``opt:<i>``) as fresh
turns.

Dependency direction is ``telegram -> messaging`` (allowed). The security
``tool_gate`` and spawn auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.
