"""ACP Runtime for multiplexed kiro-cli sessions.

Single-reader demux architecture: one AcpRuntime owns the subprocess and a
reader task that routes frames by sessionId to per-session queues. Each
``AcpSessionHandle`` (in ``session_handle.py``) owns one sessionId + queue and
provides the prompt/cancel/approve/reject API.

The per-session handle, the runtime protocol it depends on, and the runtime
exceptions live in ``session_handle.py`` (the lower layer); they are re-exported
here so ``from kiro_crew.acp.runtime import AcpSessionHandle`` (and the
exceptions) keeps working for existing callers and tests.

# incident out of the retained 8MB window before anyone can read them.
