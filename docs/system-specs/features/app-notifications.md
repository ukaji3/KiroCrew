# App Notification Producers (Push Endpoint) — Design Document

## Overview

Phase 2 of the local notification bus (`docs/request-for-change/rfc-local-notification-bus.md`): installed apps become first-class notification producers. An app declares its channels in `app.json`, then pushes notifications through `POST /api/notifications/push` authenticated with its app token. The gateway resolves the producer identity server-side from the verified token (never from the request body), enforces manifest-declared channels, and applies a per-app rate limit. Delivered notes flow through the Phase 1 `NotificationBus` sink (`DashboardState._deliver_note`), which redacts, broadcasts to SSE clients, and persists.

## API

### POST /api/notifications/push

App-token-only endpoint (dashboard-user tokens are rejected with 403: they have no app identity, and the endpoint is for producers). Registered in `server.py` `_register_mcp_routes`, so it serves both the dashboard app and the headless gateway.

Request body (JSON, max 64 KB — enforced on Content-Length AND incrementally on the raw stream so chunked transfer-encoding cannot bypass it):

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `channel` | string | yes | A channel id declared in the app's manifest (bare id, not the full dotted name) |
| `title` | string | yes | Validated by `NotificationPayload.validate()` (length caps) |
| `body` | string | yes | Length-capped |
| `priority` | string | no | `critical` / `default` / `passive`; defaults to the channel's `defaultPriority` |
| `group_key`, `url`, `icon`, `ttl`, `actions`, `meta` | — | no | Passed through payload validation; `url` must be a dashboard-internal path. Each `actions[]` entry requires `id` + `label`; an entry MAY carry a `url`, validated with the same dashboard-internal-path rule at persistence time (the trust root — no stored action can hold an external link) |

The note's `source` is always `app:<name>` resolved from the verified token; `channel` becomes `<app-name>.<channel-id>`.

Responses: `200` with `{"ok": true, "note": {...}}` where `note` is the enriched note (resolved `source`, full `channel`, effective `priority`, server timestamp `ts`); `400` (validation failure — including a corrupt on-disk manifest `defaultPriority`), `403` (no app token / app disabled or unknown / channel not declared), `413` (oversized body), `429` (rate limited), `500` (delivery or persistence failure, SEL-audited). A `200` is a durability guarantee: the handler awaits the persist job before acknowledging, so an accepted push cannot be silently lost to a disk failure. Legacy system producers remain best-effort fire-and-forget.

### Deep-linking a push back to its notification

`ts` is the note's store id — every mutating notification API keys on it, and both the push response and the WS notification envelope carry it. A producer relaying pushes off the gateway (e.g. an ntfy bridge setting a Click URL) can therefore link the tap straight to the notification it is about:

```
/notifications?note=<url-encoded ts>
```

`ts` is an ISO-8601 UTC string (e.g. `2026-08-10T09:47:47.726985+00:00`), so the value MUST be percent-encoded: the embedded `+` would otherwise decode as a space and never match.

The dashboard notifications page resolves the `note` param through the same select path as a tapped row (so it auto-acks and opens the detail — full-width on mobile, scrolled into view in the feed on desktop), then consumes the param with a history replace so reload/back does not re-select or re-ack. An id that no longer exists (expired past the ring cap, deleted, or cleared) degrades to the plain page with nothing selected and no error. The param name is part of the page's contract with external pushers; it is defined as `NOTE_DEEP_LINK_PARAM` in `website/src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx`.

### Request pipeline order

`validate -> register-channel-once -> rate-limit token -> bus.push`, chosen so that:

- Invalid payloads and corrupt-manifest 400s never consume a rate-limit token (the budget caps DELIVERED notifications).
- Channel registration happens at most once per channel (re-registering every push would stomp future runtime priority overrides).
- A `NotificationValidationError` escaping `bus.push` (unreachable today; safety net) refunds the token. A sink failure (e.g. disk full) deliberately does NOT refund: delivery may be partial, and throttling a producer while the gateway is failing is protective.

## Manifest schema: `notifications.channels`

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "channels": [
      { "id": "sync-status", "name": "Sync status", "defaultPriority": "passive" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Validation (`apps/manifest.py`): max 8 channels per app, kebab-case ids, unique ids, `defaultPriority` in the priority enum. The `notifications` block is covered by `signing_payload()` when non-empty, so channel declarations (including any `critical` default priority) are tamper-evident post-signing; manifests without channels produce a byte-identical signing payload to pre-Phase-2 manifests (backward compatible).

## Authorization

- **Token gate** (`token_auth.py` `app_token_path_allowed`): app tokens are deny-by-default; a single carve-out grants every app token exactly `/api/notifications/push`. Deliberately NOT `/api/notifications` — that path also serves GET (read history) and DELETE, which app tokens must not reach.
- **Handler checks**: app must be installed AND enabled (`is_app_enabled`, a read-only accessor safe for `asyncio.to_thread` — unlike `get_app` it has no version-sync write side effect), and the channel must be declared in the manifest. Manifest reads run off-loop via `asyncio.to_thread` (TOCTOU window accepted: one final notification from a just-disabled app).
- **Auditing**: every denial, error, and grant emits SEL `log_api_access` with the caller identity.

## Rate limiting

`notifications/rate_limit.py` `AppRateLimiter`: per-app token bucket, 30 notifications per 5 minutes with burst 10. State-owned (`DashboardState.notification_rate_limiter`), not a module global, so its lifecycle matches the gateway instance and tests get isolation. Buckets are never evicted; growth is bounded because only installed, enabled apps reach the limiter (unknown apps 403 earlier). `refund(app_name)` returns one token (capped at burst) for requests that consumed a token but delivered nothing.

## Delivery and event-loop safety

`bus.push` delivers synchronously into `DashboardState._deliver_note` (redact, append to in-memory log, SSE broadcast). Persistence (JSONL append + trim) does blocking file I/O; because the sink is externally drivable in Phase 2, ALL notification file mutations run on a dedicated single-worker executor when a loop is running: appends from the delivery sink AND whole-file rewrites from delete/ack/unack/clear. Single-worker execution means strict submission order — a rewrite submitted after an append can never be overtaken by that append, so a deleted notification cannot be resurrected by a still-queued persist. Mutation endpoints (`delete_notification`, `ack_notification`, `unack_notification`, `clear_notifications`) are async and await durability before responding; the delivery sink stays fire-and-forget (a push response does not need to wait for disk). Snapshot copies are handed to the executor so later loop-side mutation (e.g. ack flags) cannot race serialization. No locks are taken on the event loop and no file I/O runs on it. Sync callers (tests, CLI) persist inline.

## Testing

`test/test_notifications_push.py` (39 tests): auth bypass attempts, undeclared channels, oversized/chunked bodies, rate limit + refund semantics, falsy-but-valid fields, signing-payload coverage, register-once behavior, sink-failure 500. `test/test_dashboard.py` covers persistence, load-time redaction, and the executor-offloaded persist path.

## Channel lifecycle

Channels register lazily on an app's first push to each declared channel. On app uninstall or disable, `NotificationBus.unregister_app_channels(app_name)` removes every `<app>.*` channel from the registry (wired in `apps/routes.py`); re-enabling re-registers lazily on the next push. System channels are never removable. The app name `system` is rejected at manifest validation (`RESERVED_APP_NAMES`) AND denied defense-in-depth at the push endpoint, so app channels can never shadow the reserved `system.*` namespace.

## Per-channel settings (Phase 3)

User preferences per channel, stored in `~/.kiro/crew/notification_settings.json` (`notifications/settings.py`, state-owned `ChannelSettings`, atomic-rename writes, corrupt file falls back to defaults):

- **Mute**: the note still lands in history (mute silences, it does not destroy) but is stamped `silenced: true` with priority forced to `passive`, so every attention surface skips it — the unread badge counts only non-passive rows, and sound/banner/feed styling key off the same fields.
- **Priority override**: the user's value replaces the producer-requested priority and channel default.
- **Protected channels** (`system.approval`): cannot be muted and cannot have priority lowered — enforced at the settings API (400) AND at apply time, so even a hand-edited settings file cannot silence approvals (RFC exit criteria: approval still interrupts while heartbeat can be silenced everywhere).

Settings are applied at the delivery sink (`_deliver_note`), before append/broadcast, so SSE clients and disk both see the user's view; the bus stays pure.

API (dashboard-user only; app tokens have no grant here):
- `GET /api/notifications/channels` — every registered channel plus channels with stored settings (even if currently unregistered, e.g. app disabled), each with `source`, `default_priority`, `protected`, and `settings`.
- `PUT /api/notifications/channels/settings` — body `{"channel", "muted"?, "priority"?}`; `priority: null` clears the override. Changes broadcast over WS as `notification_channel_settings`.

## Phase 5: cleanup and agent tool (delivered)

- **`send_notification` MCP tool**: agent sessions publish schema-v2 notifications through the fixed `system.agent` channel via `POST /api/notifications/agent` (`source`/`channel` are server-fixed, never body-supplied; full payload validation applies — internal-path urls, action caps, length caps; a `200` awaits the persist like the app push; app tokens are refused at the handler — apps publish through their own token-verified endpoint). Governed by the same messaging capability gate as `send_message`. Caller identity resolves strictly, in order: (0) the gateway-injected per-call caller context (`_meta.kirocrew.caller`, installed by the stdio dispatch loop via `mcp_caller.set_current_caller` — the authoritative identity in the pooled/warm-pool topology, where gatewayd strips client-forged blocks and injects its own from the claim-push at `rekey()`), (1) `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY` env, (2) HMAC-verified `KIROCREW_HOST_PID` pid file; the tool fails closed with no verified identity. Channel agents (`channel:*` caller keys) are denied at MCP dispatch for BOTH `send_message` and `send_notification` — the interactive `channel.py` guard only fires on permission-request events, which auto-approved calls never emit.
- **TTL sweeper**: passive notes carrying a positive integer `ttl` (seconds) expire once `ts + ttl` passes. Swept in-memory at load and lazily on every delivery (the log is capped, so the scan is cheap); disk catches up on the next full rewrite. Only passive notes sweep — critical/default history has recall value. Ambiguous timestamps are kept, never destroyed.
- **Delivery to additional channels: planned, superseding the earlier Slack-escalation design**. A per-channel routing preference (`deliver_to`: a set of connected chat transports — Slack/Discord/Telegram/Webex/WeCom — plus a minimum-priority filter) will fan matching notes out to those transports, governed per transport through the `channels/<transport>` allowlist via the shared `vet_and_audit` seam. The earlier Slack-only, away-detection escalation shape was rejected (transport-specific and presence-sniffing); it never shipped.
- **Kind-fallback cleanup: deferred (precondition unmet)**. The RFC gates removal on telemetry showing no legacy rows in the active window, but all system producers still route through the legacy `notify()` adapter by design (backward-compat table: "Signature unchanged; adapter forwards to bus indefinitely"), so legacy-shaped rows are permanent in the active window. The `kind` field remains load-normalized and presentation-only.

## Phase 4: inline actions and grouping (delivered)

- **Action contract**: an `actions[]` entry is `{id, label, url?}`. `id` + `label` are required non-empty strings; `url` is optional and validated at persistence time with the dashboard-internal-path rule (same validator as the note-level `url` — `_validate_internal_url` in `notifications/bus.py`). Caps at validation: at most 4 actions per notification, `id` ≤ 64 chars, `label` ≤ 40 chars, `url` ≤ 500 chars (every action renders as a button on every surface, so unbounded counts/lengths would distort feed layout). The frontend renders an action as a navigation button only when it carries a `url` (`safeInternalUrl` in `notifMeta.tsx` re-checks client-side as defense-in-depth, plus string-type guards for legacy persisted rows); **url-less actions are legal, persist, and render nothing today** — they reserve dispatch semantics for a future phase.
- **Approval inline resolution**: unacked `approval` notes render one-click Approve/Reject in the feed (bell popover and page), dispatching to the existing `POST /api/approvals/{id}/{action}` endpoint.
- **`group_key` stacking**: notes sharing a `group_key` within a date group collapse to the newest head. The mac sheet renders a layered deck (click the collapsed head to expand, quiet "Show less" capsule); the panel variant uses an explicit "N more" pill.
- **Deep links**: the detail panel renders an Open button for a note-level `url` and buttons for url-carrying actions (same validation).
- **Dock badge**: the renderer mirrors the unread (non-passive, non-silenced) count to `app.setBadgeCount` via a `badge:set` IPC bridge; clamp lives in `electron/badge.js`.

## Known follow-ups

- Phase 3 frontend: settings UI section (channel list grouped by source), priority tiers wired through sound/native banner/feed styling, provisional keep/mute prompt for the first notification from a new app channel.
- Phase 4 follow-ups: surface inline-approval failures as a per-row transient error state (currently a console diagnostic; the row stays retryable); hoist dock-badge mirroring from `NotificationsBellButton` to an app-level effect with badge cleanup on teardown.
- Phase 5 follow-ups: run the TTL sweep in the GET handler too (today it runs at load and on delivery); propagate sweep removals to connected clients (broadcast expired timestamps over WS/SSE or trigger a list refetch — today an active dashboard retains an expired passive row until reload); add `ttl` to the `send_notification` tool schema (purely additive); per-channel delivery routing to additional chat transports (see the planned bullet above).
