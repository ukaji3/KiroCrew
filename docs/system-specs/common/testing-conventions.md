# Testing Conventions

## Framework

- `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` for async tests
- Coverage via `pytest-cov`

## File Layout

```
test/
├── test_acp_types.py     # ACP type dataclasses
├── test_acp_client.py    # ACP client (mocked subprocess)
├── test_config.py        # Config loader
└── test_cli.py           # CLI commands
```

## Patterns

### Grouping
Group related tests in classes:
```python
class TestAcpClientInit:
    def test_defaults(self): ...
    def test_custom_work_dir(self, tmp_path): ...
```

### Async tests
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_read_message(self, tmp_path):
    ...
```

### Mocking kiro-cli
Never spawn real `kiro-cli` in tests. Mock the subprocess:
```python
mock_process = MagicMock()
mock_stdout = AsyncMock()
mock_stdout.readline = AsyncMock(return_value=line.encode())
mock_process.stdout = mock_stdout
mock_process.returncode = None
client._process = mock_process
```

### Config overrides
Use `monkeypatch` to override config paths:
```python
def test_load_from_file(self, tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr("kiro_crew.config.loader.config_path", lambda: cfg_file)
```

### Filesystem tests
Use `tmp_path` fixture:
```python
def test_custom_work_dir(self, tmp_path):
    client = AcpClient(work_dir=tmp_path)
```

### Links: use the conftest helpers, do not skip on Windows

Creating a symlink on Windows needs `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`; an unelevated
developer shell lacks it and `os.symlink` raises `OSError [WinError 1314]`. A
**directory junction** needs no privilege and is followed by the same reparse
machinery — `rglob`, `Path.resolve` and `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` all traverse
it identically — so a junction exercises the behaviour under test on the platform
where these path semantics differ most. Two helpers in `test/conftest.py`:

| Need | Helper |
|------|--------|
| A path that reaches OUT of a sandbox root through a link | `make_escaping_link(inside, outside)` |
| A directory link at a chosen location (`ui/` -> the dev source tree) | `make_dir_link(link, target)` |

Prefer either over a bare `Path.symlink_to` plus a `skipif(sys.platform == "win32")`:
an unconditional skip drops the whole assertion on Windows. Reach for a skip only
where the *link kind itself* is the subject (a file symlink's `lstat` mode bits,
say), and then still pair it with a Windows counterpart.

### Patch the defining module, not a re-export

`monkeypatch.setattr`/`patch` rebind a NAME in one module namespace. Code
reads its globals from its **defining** module, so patching a package
re-export (e.g. `kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.X`, imported there from
`handlers/sessions.py`) is a **silent no-op** — the test still passes but
exercises the production value. Symptom: a test that "shortens" a timeout yet
still takes the full production duration.

```python
# WRONG — handlers/__init__.py only re-exports the constant; sessions.py
# still reads its own module global (test silently waits the real 10s):
monkeypatch.setattr("kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers._SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS", 0.05)

# RIGHT — patch where the constant is defined and read:
monkeypatch.setattr("kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.sessions._SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS", 0.05)
```

### Loop-wiring tests stub every dispatched operation

A test that drives a periodic/maintenance loop (e.g. `SessionManager.
_cleanup_loop`) pins the loop's *wiring* — which operations run, with what
args, and when. Stub **all** of them: any sweep left unstubbed runs for real
against the dev machine (process-table scans, `~/.kiro/crew` PID files), which
violates the isolation rules below and costs seconds per test (an unstubbed
`find_orphan_mcp_candidates` alone added ~9s to every `TestCleanupLoop`
test). The sweep's own behavior belongs in its own module's tests.

## Which conftest you are standing on

There are **three** testpaths (`setup.cfg`'s `testpaths = test transfer
src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins`) and they do **not** get the same fixtures. Know which
floor is under your file before you decide what to isolate yourself:

| Your test lives in | It inherits |
|---|---|
| `test/` | the rootdir `conftest.py` **and** `test/conftest.py` |
| `transfer/` | the rootdir `conftest.py` only |
| `src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/*/tests/` | the rootdir `conftest.py`, plus that app's own `tests/conftest.py` where one exists (`auto_improvement`, `code_review_sage`, `spec_builder` have one; the other five apps do not) |

The **rootdir `conftest.py` is the host-mutation floor**: everything in it protects the
developer's machine rather than the correctness of one suite, so it holds for all
three testpaths. It pins `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and the launchd paths, traps the spawn
funnels against service mutation, pins `KIROCREW_HOME` and the import-time `~/.kiro`
bindings, redirects `tempfile`'s base, and fails the run on residue in the checkout.

It also pins the other real host paths a test must not reach: the subagent registry (a
running gateway sweeps stray entries there as orphans), the 610MB embedding-model
download, and the agent-state sidecar.

`test/conftest.py` holds the rest: suite-specific isolation (Slack thread state, the
model-window cache, the platform context, …), the Windows collect-ignore list, and the
xdist worker budget.

When you add isolation, put it in the rootdir conftest **only** if a test in any
testpath could damage the host without it. Otherwise it belongs in `test/conftest.py`,
where it costs the in-package suites nothing.

## Rules

- Tests MUST NOT spawn real kiro-cli processes
- Tests MUST NOT depend on `~/.kiro/crew/` existing
- Tests MUST NOT write into the operator's real data dir. `KIROCREW_HOME` is pinned
  per test by the rootdir conftest, which is what makes `config_dir()` safe — and it
  needs to be, because resolving it is **not a read**: it creates the home and its
  marker on first use, and can run the one-time `~/.kirocrew` → `~/.kiro/crew`
  migration as a side effect.

  Two kinds of path escape that env var, and both need their own pin:

  1. **Bound at import time from `config_dir()`** — e.g.
     `subagent_persistence._SUBAGENTS_DIR`, set to `config_dir() / "subagents"` on
     first import. The env var is read *after* the module captured the path, so
     `conftest.py` pins each such global with a dedicated autouse fixture
     (`_isolate_subagents_dir`, …). Paths that instead call `config_dir()` lazily on
     each use (e.g. `agent_state`) already honor `KIROCREW_HOME`. A test that spawns
     subagents without isolating the import-time global leaks stub folders into
     `~/.kiro/crew/subagents/`, which a running gateway then sweeps as orphans on its
     next restart.
  2. **Bound at import time from `Path.home()`** — `~/.kiro` is *kiro-cli's* home,
     machine-wide and shared with the real installed agent, so it is a separate
     isolation axis from the data home entirely. `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` is the
     live agent's MCP server list. The rootdir conftest's `_isolate_shared_kiro_paths`
     redirects these from a table, and
     `test/test_host_isolation_floor.py::TestTheSharedKiroPathRatchet` fails when
     `src/kiro_crew` grows a module-level `Path.home()` binding that is neither in the
     table nor explicitly excluded with a reason. The guarantee is exactly that:
     **import-time bindings**. A LAZY resolver (`config.paths.kiro_home()` and its
     callers) still names the operator's real `~/.kiro` — the floor pins neither
     `Path.home()` nor `$HOME` — so a test that reaches one of those must isolate it
     itself.

     Two exclusions are excluded for **opposite** reasons, and the distinction
     matters: the launchd paths are excluded because another fixture already
     redirects them, while `security._EXTRACT_INTO_TRUST_ROOT_RE` and
     `kiro_usage_api._CLI_SQLITE_DBS` must **never** be redirected — they are
     security anchors whose whole point is naming the real home. **Stub the reader,
     never move the anchor.** Redirecting a matcher so a test can pass makes it assert
     against a pattern that no longer matches the thing it protects.

- **Never leave the process working directory somewhere else.** The CWD is
  per-PROCESS, so under xdist one test's `os.chdir` becomes every later test's starting
  directory on that worker. Use `monkeypatch.chdir`, which reverts on its own; the
  rootdir conftest's `_restore_cwd` puts it back either way.

  This was survivable only while the directory outlived the run. With
  `tmp_path_retention_policy = failed` pytest removes a passing test's `tmp_path` at
  that test's teardown, so a test that chdirs into `tmp_path` and does not come back
  leaves the worker sitting in a **deleted** directory — and then `Path.cwd()` raises
  `FileNotFoundError` in every later test that reaches it, including from inside
  production code (`taskrunner.TaskRunner.__init__` does `work_dir or Path.cwd()`).
  MEASURED: that one leak produced the large majority of a 124-failure run, spread
  across ~10 files that every one of which passes in isolation — which is exactly why
  it reads as "the suite is flaky" instead of as one test missing one line.

- **A singleton with a background thread beats every filesystem cleanup.** `sel.py` is
  the worked example: `SecurityEventLog` is a process singleton whose writer is a
  *daemon thread*, and `_init_locked` binds its directory **once**, from whatever
  `_default_dir()` resolved at that moment. So whichever test calls `sel()` first fixes
  the directory for the whole worker, the thread keeps writing there after that test
  ends, and `_flush_batch` opens with `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` — which
  **re-creates the directory after the test's own tearDown removed it**. MEASURED: that
  is what left one stray `mkdtemp` directory behind on every run of the
  ops-mission-control suite, and the stack came from `sel-writer`, not from any test.

  The fix is not tidier cleanup — no cleanup can win against a thread that rebuilds
  the path. It is to give the singleton a **session-scoped** directory that belongs to
  no individual test (`_isolate_sel_default_dir`, in the rootdir conftest). When you
  add a subsystem with a background worker, ask which directory its thread captured
  and whether anything deletes that directory underneath it.
- Tests MUST NOT reconfigure or restart a real host service. This is enforced,
  not just asked for: the **rootdir** `conftest.py` (distinct from
  `test/conftest.py`, which only applies to `test/` — `testpaths` also collects
  `transfer` and `src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins`) pins `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to a tmp
  dir so `dev_fleet._dropin_path()` cannot name the operator's real
  `~/.config/systemd/user/kirocrew-gateway.service.d/`, and traps every stdlib
  spawn funnel (`subprocess.Popen.__init__`,
  `BaseEventLoop.subprocess_exec`/`subprocess_shell`, `os.execve`) to
  refuse a `systemctl`/`launchctl` invocation carrying a **mutating verb**
  (`restart`, `daemon-reload`, `stop`, `enable`, `load`, `bootout`, …). Read-only
  queries (`systemctl show`, `cat`, `is-active`) are allowed and need no stub,
  and `systemd-run` is deliberately NOT guarded because `sandbox` wraps nearly
  every subprocess in `systemd-run --scope` for cgroup limits — the guard keys on
  the verb, so it still catches `systemd-run … -- systemctl restart …` on the
  inner token. A test that reaches the make-live cutover path must stub BOTH
  `_run_cmd` and `_dropin_path`. Issue #1722: a test asserting that a staged
  cutover could be *cancelled* rewrote the developer's real unit to point into
  its own pytest temp dir, and systemd then looped on `203/EXEC` for 25 minutes
  after that dir was deleted. `test/test_host_service_guard.py` ratchets the
  guarded set against the service tools `src/` actually names, so a new
  host-mutating call site cannot land outside the floor.
- **Register the destruction of anything you create, in the same scope.** Prefer
  pytest's `tmp_path`. If you must call `tempfile.mkdtemp()`, pair it with
  `self.addCleanup(shutil.rmtree, path, ignore_errors=True)` **on the next line** —
  not with an `rmtree` in `tearDown`, which is the shape that leaks:

  ```python
  # WRONG — unittest does NOT run tearDown when setUp raises, so this leaks on
  # every setUp failure, and it is the failing run nobody watches that leaves it
  def setUp(self):
      self.tmp = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp())
      self.client = build_client()          # raises -> tearDown never runs
  def tearDown(self):
      shutil.rmtree(self.tmp, ignore_errors=True)

  # RIGHT — registered immediately, runs even if the rest of setUp blows up
  def setUp(self):
      self.tmp = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp())
      self.addCleanup(shutil.rmtree, self.tmp, ignore_errors=True)
      self.client = build_client()
  ```

  The rootdir conftest contains the *class* as well: `tempfile`'s base is redirected
  per run to `<platform temp>/kc-pytest-<user>-<pid>`, which the run removes at the end,
  so an unregistered directory no longer accumulates in the shared temp root forever.
  Residue there is still **reported** — relocation is not absolution.

  A run only ever deletes the root it created itself — there is deliberately no sweep of
  other runs' roots, because every signal for "that directory is abandoned" is unsound from
  inside a test process: the name can be pre-created by another local account, and a pid
  means nothing across PID namespaces (two containers sharing a bind-mounted temp directory
  can each hold the same one). So **a run killed before its teardown leaves one directory
  for the platform to reclaim** — `systemd-tmpfiles` on a timer, macOS's periodic cleanup, a
  tmpfs cleared on reboot. That reliance is deliberate and is worth knowing if you own a
  long-lived CI host: it is bounded at one directory per killed run.

  Reported, not yet fatal, and that split is a staged rollout rather than a soft opinion.
  Two classes under that root are deliberately **not** residue and are excluded by name:
  the computer-use screenshot spool, which production keeps as a persistent ring buffer,
  and the scratch that Chromium and the Playwright driver create because a child inherits
  the redirected `TMPDIR`. What remains is a handful of single `mkstemp` **files**, some
  of them written by production code a test merely reached — one inode each, not the
  `mkdtemp` directories the rule is about. Failing the suite on that set today would
  block every unrelated change while it is attributed, and a guard that blocks unrelated
  work is a guard somebody deletes. Set `KIROCREW_TMP_RESIDUE_STRICT=1` to make it fatal,
  which is how the remaining set gets burned down and how the line gets held afterwards —
  the same shape as `windows-expected-failures.txt`.

  Why it is worth a guard rather than a convention: `/tmp` is commonly a tmpfs with a
  fixed **inode** budget (1,048,576 on the hosts this was measured on), and it returns
  `ENOSPC` to every other process on the machine while **90% of the bytes are still
  free**. MEASURED on one such host: retained pytest basetemps alone held 249,550
  inodes, a quarter of the whole budget — which is why `setup.cfg` now sets
  `tmp_path_retention_policy = failed`, keeping a `tmp_path` only for the tests whose
  directory anyone actually opens.

  **Finding the culprit.** The residue report runs in a session-fixture teardown, so it
  is attributed to the last test the worker ran, which is almost never the guilty one.
  Re-run the suspect subset with `KIROCREW_TMP_PER_TEST=1` and each residue name
  becomes the id of the test that leaked it:

  ```bash
  KIROCREW_TMP_PER_TEST=1 pytest src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/<app>/tests -n0 -q
  # AssertionError: 1 temporary entry outlived this run under /tmp/kc-pytest-you-951504:
  #     test_provider_listing_never_contains_a_token/tmpw2kvty2z
  ```

  That mode is off by default because a directory per test is exactly the per-test cost
  the fixture audit below exists to avoid.

- Tests SHOULD be fast (< 1s each)
- Async tests MUST use `@pytest.mark.asyncio`

## Running the suite: the defaults, and how to narrow safely

The checkpoint run is the whole suite with the configured defaults:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

`setup.cfg`'s `[tool:pytest] addopts` supplies `--verbose`,
`--ignore=build/private`, `-n auto`, `--dist loadgroup`, `--max-worker-restart=2`,
`--timeout=120`, `--durations=5` and `--color=yes`. Coverage is deliberately NOT in
`addopts`: measured on a 1,231-test subset it cost +21% wall time and +36% peak
worker RSS on every local and agent run, while CI asks for it explicitly. So you no
longer need an override just to avoid coverage.

### A multi-test `--override-ini` MUST re-state the xdist flags

`--override-ini="addopts=..."` REPLACES the whole list. Anything you leave out is
silently gone, and two of the defaults are load-bearing:

- **`--dist loadgroup`** is what honors `@pytest.mark.xdist_group`. Under
  `loadgroup` the scheduling unit is a test's own nodeid unless it carries the mark,
  in which case the group collapses to a shared scope and those tests land on ONE
  worker. Drop the flag and the concurrency-sensitive tests that depend on
  serialization are scattered across workers, which produces flaky races rather than
  a clean failure. Nothing warns you.
- **`--max-worker-restart=2`** turns worker loss into a fast loud failure. Without a
  cap, xdist silently clones replacements up to `numprocesses * 4`: a 10-worker run
  quietly restarts 40 times, and on a host that has started swapping that is roughly
  20 minutes of zero progress and an empty log. Two replacements absorb a genuine
  one-off crash; past that the run is not going to finish.

When worker replacement itself ends in an xdist INTERNALERROR (exit 3, no
`short test summary info` at all -- the scheduler can die with a `KeyError` on a
replaced node), `test/conftest.py`'s `pytest_internalerror` hook prints an
`xdist run ABANDONED` banner to stderr replaying the crashed workers and the
tests they were running, so the red stays diagnosable. The run still exits
non-zero; the banner only preserves the report the crash would otherwise erase.

So any override that still runs MANY tests must carry
`-n auto --dist loadgroup --max-worker-restart=2`:

```bash
python -m pytest --testmon \
  --override-ini="addopts=-v --ignore=build/private -n auto --dist loadgroup --max-worker-restart=2 --durations=5 --color=yes" \
  -q 2>&1 | tail -25
```

### Selective execution with testmon

`pytest-testmon` tracks which source files each test touches and runs only the
tests affected by your changes. It is declared in `setup.cfg`'s `dev` extra (what
`make build` installs), not in `pyproject.toml`'s `dependency-groups` dev that CI
uses, so a CI-shaped environment will not have it.

```bash
# Only tests affected by the current changes.
python -m pytest --testmon --override-ini="addopts=..." -q

# Only the tests that failed last run.
python -m pytest --lf --override-ini="addopts=..." -q
```

The first `--testmon` run builds the dependency database, so it costs a full pass;
the wins come after.

### One file or one test: use `-n0`

Per-worker startup dominates a small selection, so parallelism makes a narrow run
SLOWER. One measured test took 36.9s under `-n 2` and about 1.4s under `-n0`.

```bash
python -m pytest test/test_dashboard_chat.py -n0 -q
python -m pytest -k "flush_segment" -n0 -q
python -m pytest -n0 -k test_name --pdb        # -n0 is also what makes --pdb usable
```

`-n0` on the command line overrides the `addopts` `-n auto` without replacing the
rest of the list, which is why a single-file run needs no `--override-ini` at all.

### Which to use when

| Scenario | Command |
|---|---|
| Iterating on one task | `pytest --testmon` with the full override above |
| Debugging a specific failure | `pytest --lf` with the override, or `-k "test_name" -n0` |
| One file | `pytest test/test_foo.py -n0 -q` |
| Checkpoint before committing | `black && isort && flake8 && mypy && python -m pytest` |

## Determinism: the five flake classes

A test that fails on CI but not locally is almost always one of these. Each has one
correct fix; reruns and `sleep` increases are not among them.

### 1. Nondeterministic input

Feeding `os.urandom` / `random` / `uuid4` into an assertion that depends on a property
the RNG does not guarantee. A random opaque id is fine; a random *payload* asserted to
NOT match a pattern is a coin flip.

Fix: seed it. `random.Random(_SEED).randbytes(n)` keeps the payload high-entropy,
which is usually the property under test, while fixing the outcome. Verify the chosen
seed against the real predicate, and say in a comment that you did.

```python
# WRONG: ~1% of runs match a credential prefix and the exemption assert fails
body = os.urandom(20_000)
# RIGHT: same entropy, same code path, one outcome
body = random.Random(20260803).randbytes(20_000)
```

### 2. Wall-clock races

Asserting a *rate* or a *count* that the host controls. Windows rounds `time.sleep` /
`Event.wait` up to ~15.6ms and a loaded runner starves threads, so "burn 0.25s at a 2ms
interval, expect ~125 samples" observed **one** sample in CI.

Fix: poll for the condition with a generous deadline, and keep the assertion. Never
extend a fixed sleep, which trades flakiness for wall-clock and still races.

```python
# WRONG: assumes the scheduler cooperates
do_work_for(0.25); assert observed()
# RIGHT: returns as soon as it is true, fails loudly if it never is
give_up_at = time.monotonic() + 30.0
while not observed():
    assert time.monotonic() < give_up_at, "never happened"
    do_work_for(0.05)
```

Where a test wants a timeout to *expire*, set it to `0` rather than a small value: the
same branch is reached with no clock dependency at all.

### 3. Leaked async objects

An `AsyncMock` standing in for a **synchronous** method (`StreamWriter.write`,
`stdin.close`) returns a coroutine nobody awaits. A `cancel()` that is never awaited
leaves a live task at loop teardown. Both surface as `RuntimeWarning: coroutine ... was
never awaited` / `coroutine ignored GeneratorExit`, attributed to whichever *later* test
happened to trigger the GC, so the reported test is rarely the guilty one.

Fix: `MagicMock()` for sync methods; `await` the task after `cancel()`, absorbing
`CancelledError`.

### 4. Order dependence and shared state

Under `-n auto --dist loadgroup` the scheduling unit is a test's **own nodeid** unless it
carries an `xdist_group` mark: `LoadGroupScheduling._split_scope` returns the nodeid
verbatim and only collapses to a shared scope for tests marked `@<group>`. So ordinary
tests are distributed freely and independently: which worker any given test lands on, and
which tests precede it there, changes run to run. That is exactly why cross-test pollution
surfaces as flakiness rather than as a reproducible ordering bug, and why an `xdist_group`
mark is the tool for a test that genuinely cannot share a worker.

Mutate process globals through `monkeypatch`, which reverts on teardown even when the
test fails. Raw assignment does not.

### 5. Absolute time budgets on instrumented runs

Asserting a *duration* when the property under test is algorithmic **complexity**. CI enables
coverage on one Python version only (`--cov` on 3.12, `--no-cov` on 3.10), and instrumentation
multiplies the cost of every executed line — so the same un-regressed code measured ~1.7s of CPU
bare and >5s under coverage, and one shard failed on 3.12 while passing on 3.10 **at the identical
commit**. The tell is a timing test that splits by Python version rather than by machine load.

`time.process_time` fixes only the other half: it removes co-tenant scheduling noise, but CPU time
still includes the instrumentation, so an absolute ceiling stays version-dependent.

Fix: assert the **shape**, not the magnitude — and prefer asserting it *deterministically*.
When the code under test has an instrumentation surface (a routing decision, a memoized
matcher, a countable set of engine invocations), assert on that: pin that the linear path
is the one taken, wrap the primitives, and require the invocation trace to be IDENTICAL
when the input doubles. That fails only on the property, never on the runner. A *timed*
doubling ratio is version-independent (a constant multiplier cancels) but still
runner-dependent: even on `thread_time`, frequency scaling and co-tenant cache contention
on a shared runner inflated a measured 3.0-bounded ratio to 3.2x with the property intact.
Reserve a measured ratio for code with no observable structure, and make its bound
generous — a real complexity regression is orders of magnitude, so a wide bound still
catches it. Raising an absolute budget instead banks the overhead as headroom and hides
the next real regression.

```python
# WRONG: passes bare, fails under --cov, and the margin shrinks as the catalog grows
assert self._elapsed(build(8000)) < 5.0
# WRONG on shared runners: a timed doubling ratio — even thread-CPU — false-reds under
# frequency scaling / co-tenant contention (measured 3.2x against a 3.0 bound)
# RIGHT: doubling the input must not change WHAT the engine executes; only each single
# linear scan gets longer (see test_mid_dotstar_chain_spam_stays_linear)
assert traced(build(4000)) == traced(build(2000))
```

Keep a *small*-`n` absolute assertion alongside it so a uniform slowdown is still caught, and
verify the threshold against a mutated implementation rather than reasoning about it.

## Keeping the suite fast

The suite is ~26.5k tests. At that count a per-test cost is multiplied by 26,500, so
setup overhead, not any single slow test, is what dominates. Profile before optimizing:

```bash
# Per-test durations for the whole suite (writes a JSON map)
pytest -q -n auto --dist loadgroup --no-cov --store-durations --durations-path=/tmp/d.json
# One file, serially, with its own worst offenders
pytest test/test_foo.py -n0 -q --no-cov --durations=10
```

Note that `--store-durations` numbers taken under `-n auto` include worker contention
and overstate individual tests. Compare candidates **back to back** on the same machine
(`git stash` / run / `git stash pop` / run); a number from an idle machine measured an
hour earlier is not a baseline.

### The three highest-leverage patterns

1. **Audit what the autouse fixtures cost, before anything else.** Every one of them is
   paid ~26.5k times, so a few milliseconds there outweighs any single slow test. Two
   things to look for: a fixture requesting a fixture it never uses (one unused
   `tmp_path` allocated a directory for every test in the suite), and repeated
   `tmp_path_factory.mktemp` calls, which pick a numbered suffix by scanning the whole
   basetemp, so it gets slower as siblings accumulate. Allocate one session-scoped
   parent and `mkdir` under it instead. Measure the whole chain against a file of
   trivial `assert True` tests, which isolates setup cost from any real work:

   ```bash
   # 600 trivial tests, with the real conftest vs without it
   python -c "
   for i in range(600): print(f'def test_t{i}(): assert True')" > /tmp/probe/test_p.py
   cp test/conftest.py /tmp/probe/ && cd /tmp/probe && pytest test_p.py -n0 -q --no-cov
   ```

   That probe read 6.35s here before these fixes and 0.82s after: **9.2ms per test**,
   which is where most of the suite-wide win came from.
2. **Function-scoped construction of an immutable, expensive thing.** Real `git`
   repos are the worst offender here: seeding one costs ~1–1.6s in subprocesses, paid
   per test. Build it **once** in a `scope="session"` fixture and `shutil.copytree` it
   per test. This is safe only if the template is never handed to a test: copy from
   it rather than yielding it, so nothing one test does can reach another's. Re-point any
   absolute path the tool recorded (e.g. `git remote set-url`) in the copy.
3. **A production timeout or poll the test never asserts on.** Fake fixtures are often
   small enough to trip a real retry heuristic, then pay its full budget every test.
   `monkeypatch` the interval to `0`: the branch still executes, only the waiting
   goes. Confirm first that no test asserts on the interval itself.

Measured on this suite, each file run serially with `-n0 --no-cov` back to back on one
host (state the regime whenever you quote a number, because these do not compare across
regimes): `test_computer_use_snapshot_macos.py` 142.0s to 1.5s (pattern 3),
`test_md_notebook.py` 54.2s to 27.1s and `test_worktree_create.py` 20.7s to 15.8s
(pattern 2). Applying all three across ~16 files took the full suite from 281s to 116s
wall, and most of that came from the *shared* fixes, which is why the conftest audit is
item 1.

A fourth, adjacent pattern: **a patch target that misses.** Both this and § Patch the
defining module, not a re-export are the same one rule, *patch the namespace whose
globals the code under test actually reads*, and they are the two directions it fails
in. There, the caller reads its own defining module and the test patched a package
re-export. Here it is the reverse: the caller did `from pkg.mod import fn`, so it holds
its **own** binding, and patching `pkg.mod.fn` leaves that binding untouched. Either way
the REAL function runs, the assertion passes for the wrong reason, and the test pays real
time. One such target cost 6.1s and left a live transcriber running. Ask which module's
globals the call resolves through, and treat an unexpectedly slow "mocked" test as
evidence the mock missed.

### Verify an optimization did not weaken the test

A fix that makes a test faster by making it check less is a regression. Mutate the
production code the test covers and confirm the test still **fails**:

Restore from a **copy of the file you mutated**, not from git. `git checkout --` resets
the path to HEAD, which silently discards any unrelated uncommitted work in that file and
cannot be undone. And sequence it with `;`, not `&&`: with `&&` the restore runs only when
pytest exits 0, i.e. only in the case where the mutation did *not* do its job, leaving a
correctly-failing mutation in your tree.

```bash
f=src/kiro_crew/foo.py
cp "$f" "$f.premutation"                 # back up whatever is there now
# ...edit $f to invert the branch the test covers...
pytest test/test_foo.py -n0 -q           # expect RED; if it passes, the test is weak
mv "$f.premutation" "$f"                 # exact pre-mutation bytes, unrelated edits kept
git diff --stat "$f"                     # should show only what you had before
```

### Shard balance

`ci.yml` splits the backend suite into 4 `pytest-split` groups. Splitting is balanced by
recorded runtime **only when a `.test_durations` file is committed**; without one
pytest-split falls back to an even split by test *count*. No such file is committed here:
`test-durations.yml` would generate one weekly but has failed on a transient `git push`
502 both times it ran, so it has never landed.

**Measure a shard by running it, not by summing durations.** Each shard runs its own
tests at `-n 4`, so per-test times from a `--store-durations` run include worker
contention and do not add up to a shard's wall clock. Summing them predicted a 3× spread
here. Running the four shards the way CI does,

```bash
pytest -q -n 4 --no-cov --splits 4 --group <N>
```

measures **54.8 / 59.9 / 81.1 / 62.4s**, a 1.5× spread. Count-based splitting is
already close enough that committing `.test_durations` would save on the order of
seconds, so it is not the lever it looks like. The lever is the outliers: a single file
paying a 2s production poll 119 times moves a shard far more than the split ever does,
and it was the two files carrying that kind of cost that sat on the shards which failed
most.

## Exploratory Testing via Manual Command Execution

For integration issues involving external processes (kiro-cli, MCP servers, build
tools), use the **observe → diagnose → fix → verify** pattern:

### When to Use

- Debugging protocol-level issues (ACP JSON-RPC, MCP handshake)
- Investigating timing/ordering problems (async init, notification delivery)
- Verifying build pipeline behavior (setuptools, npm, pip)
- Any issue where mocked unit tests can't reproduce the real behavior

### Method

1. **Write a minimal script** that reproduces the exact subprocess interaction:
   - Spawn the real process (`kiro-cli acp`, `aim mcp install`, etc.)
   - Send inputs step by step
   - Log every output with timestamps
   - Use large stdout buffers (`limit=10*1024*1024`) to avoid truncation

2. **Observe raw behavior** — don't assume, capture everything:
   - Log all JSON-RPC messages (method, id, params keys)
   - Record timing (when does each message arrive relative to start?)
   - Note message classification (notification vs response vs request)

3. **Identify root cause** from observations, not from reading code alone

4. **Apply minimal fix** targeting the observed root cause

5. **Re-run the same script** to verify the fix works end-to-end

### Example: ACP Protocol Testing

```python
"""Test ACP handshake and MCP server loading."""
import asyncio, json, time

async def main():
    kiro = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
        "kiro-cli", "acp", "--agent", "kirocrew",
        stdin=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.DEVNULL,
        limit=10 * 1024 * 1024,
    )
    req_id = 0
    buffered = []

    async def send(method, params):
        nonlocal req_id; req_id += 1
        msg = {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": req_id, "method": method, "params": params}
        kiro.stdin.write((json.dumps(msg) + "\n").encode())
        await kiro.stdin.drain()
        return req_id

    async def wait_response(rid, timeout=120):
        """Wait for response, buffer notifications."""
        deadline = time.monotonic() + timeout
        while time.monotonic() < deadline:
            try:
                line = await asyncio.wait_for(kiro.stdout.readline(), timeout=3)
                if not line.strip(): continue
                msg = json.loads(line)
                if msg.get("method") and msg.get("id") is None:
                    buffered.append(msg)  # notification
                    continue
                if msg.get("id") == rid:
                    return msg.get("result", {})
            except (asyncio.TimeoutError, json.JSONDecodeError):
                continue
        return {}

    # Step through protocol, log everything
    t0 = time.time()
    await wait_response(await send("initialize", {
        "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
        "clientInfo": {"name": "kirocrew", "version": "0.1.0"},
    }))
    await wait_response(await send("session/new", {"cwd": "/tmp", "mcpServers": []}))

    # Check what was buffered during handshake
    for msg in buffered:
        method = msg.get("method", "")
        name = msg.get("params", {}).get("serverName", "")
        print(f"  [{time.time()-t0:.1f}s] {method} name={name}")

    kiro.kill()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Example: Build Pipeline Testing

```bash
# Reproduce: run build N times, check for flaky failures
pip install -e . && pip install -e . && pip install -e .

# Diagnose: find stale cached files
find build/ -name "SOURCES.txt" -exec grep "basePickBy" {} +

# Verify fix: same sequence must pass consistently
rm -rf build/ && pip install -e . && pip install -e . && pip install -e .
```

### Key Principles

- **Observe before fixing** — capture raw data, don't guess
- **Reproduce reliably** — if you can't trigger it on demand, you can't verify the fix
- **Test the exact flow** — simulate what the real code does (same process, same protocol, same ordering)
- **Verify N times** — flaky issues need multiple runs to confirm (3+ consecutive passes)
- **Keep test scripts** — save in `/tmp/test_*.py` during debugging, discard after fix is verified
