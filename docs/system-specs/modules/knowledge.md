# Knowledge Module

## Overview

The Knowledge Library is KiroCrew's personal knowledge graph: a local, SQLite-backed corpus that ingests documents (folders, uploads, artifacts, fetched URLs), chunks and entity-extracts them via a bounded LLM worker pool, and serves hybrid retrieval (FTS5 keyword + graph traversal + optional vector) to the LLM through the `local_knowledge_search` MCP tool. All ingestion and search stay on-host; the only external calls are the extraction/URL-fetch worker's ACP LLM turns and the local Ollama embedding endpoint.

```
files / uploads / artifacts / URLs
   → FileReader (read + extract text)

   → KnowledgeStore (SQLite: items + items_fts + graph)
   → HybridRetriever (FTS5 + graph + vector, RRF fusion)
   → local_knowledge_search (MCP) / dashboard Knowledge tab

## 1. FileReader & supported formats (`readers.py`)

`FileReader.read(path)` returns `(text, meta)`. It first refuses sensitive paths — `is_sensitive_path(path)` raises `PermissionError("Refusing to read sensitive path: …")` before any open — then dispatches by lower-cased extension.

`FileReader.SUPPORTED` (`readers.py`) is the ingestion allowlist:

```
'', '.md', '.txt', '.org', '.py', '.java', '.ts', '.js', '.rs', '.go',
'.html', '.htm', '.docx', '.pdf',
'.csv', '.log', '.json', '.yaml', '.yml', '.sh', '.rb', '.c', '.cpp', '.h'
```

It includes markdown/plain-text (`.md`/`.txt`/`.org`), source-code extensions, and the two binary formats with declared optional deps (`.pdf` → pdfplumber, `.docx` → python-docx).

**Dispatch (`_DISPATCH`, `readers.py`)** routes only `.pdf`/`.pptx`/`.docx`/`.html`/`.htm` to specialized readers. Anything else — including `.org`, `.txt`, `.md`, and every source-code extension — falls through to the generic `_read_text` path (UTF-8 with a latin-1 fallback) and into the generic chunker downstream. So `.org` is treated as plain text; there is no Org-mode-specific parser.

**`.pptx` is intentionally out of `SUPPORTED`** even though `_read_pptx` exists: python-pptx is not declared in `setup.cfg`, so the format is kept off the allowlist (the comment at `readers.py` documents this). Reachable only if `.pptx` were re-added to `SUPPORTED`.

**Binary/optional-dep readers** degrade gracefully — a missing optional import returns an `{'format': 'error'}` meta with an install hint rather than raising:
- `_read_pdf` — pdfplumber; concatenates per-page `extract_text()`, records `page_count`.
- `_read_docx` — python-docx; converts `Heading N` paragraph styles to `#`-prefixed markdown (`content_type: 'markdown'`), records `paragraph_count`.
- `_read_html` — html2text when importable (`ignore_images=True`, `ignore_links=False`); otherwise a regex fallback strips `<script>`/`<style>` and tags.

Base metadata always carries `format`, `title` (file stem), `file_size`, `extension`, and a computed `line_count`.

## 2. Folder discovery & scan (`folder_watcher.py`)

**Namespace routing**: folder/vault sources read their target namespace from `properties["namespace"]` (default `"default"`). The `add_source` handler accepts namespace either as a top-level body field or inside `properties`; a top-level `namespace` is folded into `properties` (if dict and not already set) before storage. This ensures FolderWatcher and Watcher resolve the correct namespace at scan time via `props.get("namespace", "default")`.
`FolderWatcher.scan_source(source)` scans a folder-type source under a per-`source_id` `asyncio.Lock` (one scan per source at a time) and returns `{new, changed, deleted, skipped, capped, failed}`.

**`_walk(root, ignore_patterns, extra_skip_dirs)`** (run via `asyncio.to_thread`) is the discovery step:
- Prunes `HARD_SKIP_DIRS`, any per-source-type extra skip dirs (`SOURCE_TYPE_SKIP_DIRS["obsidian_vault"] = {.obsidian, .trash}`), and **all** dotfiles/dot-dirs in place during `os.walk`.
- Skips OS junk/lock files by case-insensitive basename match against `DEFAULT_IGNORE_GLOBS` (macOS AppleDouble `._*`, `.ds_store`, Office `~$*`, LibreOffice `.~lock.*`, `thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `*.tmp`, editor swap/backup, partial downloads). This exists because a discovered-but-unreadable file that carries a supported extension fails ingestion, is never auto-retried, and would otherwise leave a source permanently stalled below 100%.
- Applies the source's `ignore_patterns` (fnmatch against the relative path).
- **Extension filter**: keeps a file only if its lower-cased suffix is in `FileReader.SUPPORTED` **or** equals `.canvas` (Obsidian canvas files).
- **Sensitive-path guard**: resolves each candidate (`Path.resolve()`) and skips it if `is_sensitive_path()` matches.
- Returns `[(full_path, mtime)]`.

**Scan bookkeeping (`_do_scan`)**:
- Discovered files above `props["max_files"]` (default `DEFAULT_MAX_FILES` = 5000) are capped **newest-first** (sort by mtime desc); the surplus count is reported as `capped`.
- Deletion detection uses the **full** discovered set (pre-cap) so capping never triggers false deletions; a vanished file's items are archived via `_handle_deleted` → `store.delete_items_batch`.
- Change detection is mtime-then-content-hash: unchanged mtime → `last_seen` bump only; changed mtime but identical SHA-256 → state refresh, no re-ingest.
- Per-file state lives in the `folder_file_state` table with `status` ∈ `{done, scanning, skipped, failed, deduped}`. `scanning` is written **before** ingest so a crash mid-file is recoverable; `skipped`/`failed`/`deduped` files are not auto-retried (user must retry).
- **TOCTOU defense**: `_ingest_file` re-resolves symlinks and re-checks `is_sensitive_path` at ingest time; a block writes `status='failed'` and emits an SEL `knowledge.source.file.ingest_denied` (`outcome="denied"`, `reason=sensitive_path_toctou`) audit event.
- After a successful scan, each newly ingested/changed file gets a **targeted** cross-source dedup (`dedup_document(..., apply=True)`) — O(k·n) over the k changed files rather than a full O(n²) corpus sweep — so a folder copy collapses any matching one-shot upload.
- **The dedup unit is always the DOCUMENT, never the source.** For a folder source a document is a `folder_file_state` row; for everything else it is one `content_hash` group of `items` (`enumerate_docs` groups by `(source_id, content_hash)`), so an aggregate source holding many documents (`artifact`, `agent`) dedups per document like any other. `_delete_doc` drops that document's items and marks its owning state row `deduped` so nothing re-ingests it; it removes the source row only once the source is provably empty (no items, no state rows, and not a folder/vault), which is what keeps a collapsed one-shot upload from lingering as an empty row. There is no source-level unit, so the former `_AGGREGATE_SOURCE_TYPES` carve-out — whose cost was that aggregate documents were never deduped at all — is gone.
- **Scheduled sweeps.** `KnowledgeWatcher._maybe_dedup_sweep` runs a full `dedup_sweep` every `knowledge.dedup_every_n_sweeps` sweeps (default 12, ~hourly at the 300s interval; 0 disables). The targeted per-ingest call and the pre-ingest exact-hash gate cannot catch a near-duplicate or a pre-existing one, so the periodic pass is required for duplicates to actually be collapsed.
- **One document, several locations.** A document held by two sources is ONE stored copy with a `source_locations` row per source, not two copies where one is destroyed. A collapse attaches the loser's source as a location of the winner's items, deletes the loser's redundant copy, and records `merged_into_source_id` on the loser's state row. Three consequences follow, and each closes a way the previous design lost data: `delete_source_cascade` re-points `items.source_id` to a surviving holder instead of deleting a document another source holds (`reassign_item_source` is the only path that moves ownership, since `_ITEM_COLUMNS` deliberately excludes the column); deleting the winner clears the marker so the document is ingested again rather than stranded; and "empty source" now means holding nothing by location either, in both the dedup check and the boot-time orphan sweep, because reaping a source would delete the very rows recording co-ownership. The marker names a SOURCE and never the winner's item ids: `item_ids` means "the items this row owns", and dedup derives a document's hash and embedding from whatever it points at, so a row naming the winner's items would be enumerated as a second document over one physical item set — and collapsing that pair deletes the surviving copy. `_match_reason` refuses any pair whose `item_ids` overlap for the same reason. Per-source counts report what a source HOLDS, while the Library total counts documents, so a shared document is visible under both sources without inflating the total.

- **Pre-ingest duplicate gate.** `IngestionPipeline._skip_as_duplicate` refuses a write whose whole-text `content_hash` already exists in another source, on every ingest path, recording a terminal `ingestion_jobs` row with `status='skipped_duplicate'`. Refusing is not the same as doing nothing: the items the call was going to REPLACE are deleted first, because the document's content changed to something already stored elsewhere and its previous items are now superseded. Leaving them would keep the old text searchable and — since the state row is then recorded with an empty group — unreachable by the deleted-file path. A folder file refused this way is marked `deduped` rather than `done`; an artifact or agent document gets the same marker in its item-state row so the owning sync does not retry a write the gate will refuse again. The gate is not order-blind: it consults the same `PERSISTENT_SOURCE_TYPES` ranking `pick_winner` uses, so an incoming **persistent** source (folder / vault / wiki) is allowed to land when the current holder is **transient** (a one-shot upload or chat capture), and the post-ingest sweep then collapses the pair keeping the persistent copy. Refusing on arrival order alone inverted that ranking: the folder copy was marked `deduped`, the only searchable copy stayed inside the upload, and deleting the upload left none. Equal rank still refuses, which is the cheap path — it skips the chunking and extraction the sweep would immediately undo. Exact-hash only — the fuzzy tier needs embeddings and cannot run inline.
- **Legacy items with a null `content_hash` are not exact-matchable.** The column arrived by `ALTER TABLE`, so rows written before it are null, and tier-1 requires both sides non-null — on a real Library that was 435 of 526 folder items. Those documents reach de-duplication only through the filename+embedding tier. Backfilling is NOT done here: the extracted text is not retained, so the pipeline's hash cannot be reproduced, and any derived value has to be grouped per DOCUMENT (`folder_file_state` / item-state rows) rather than per source — grouping by source gives every file in a folder one identical key, which the sweep then reads as an exact match and collapses. What IS enforced is that every ingest path stamps the column, asserted by test, so the gap cannot grow.

## 2b. Automatic write paths (`doc_filter.py`, `project_docs.py`, `agent_source.py`)

Two automatic paths add documents without the user registering a source by hand. Both
are on by default, both are user-disableable, and both are bounded by the same two
mechanisms: a document filter that bounds WHAT is taken, and a per-sweep chunk budget
that bounds what it COSTS. File filters control pollution; only the chunk budget
controls spend, because a handful of large documents dominates the chunk count.

**The document rule (`doc_filter.py`).** Auto-add prose written for HUMANS about
intent, decisions, and how things work; exclude prose written for AGENTS, generated
files, and machine-readable lists. Expressed as the `properties` a folder source
already understands — `include_extensions` (`.md .pdf .docx .org`; `.txt` is excluded
because inside a repository it is nearly always a list), `ignore_patterns`,
`extra_skip_dirs`, `min_file_bytes` (2048) — so the ordinary scan path applies it with
no special casing. `should_ingest_doc` is the same rule as a callable predicate, pinned
against `_walk` by a test so the two cannot drift.

Repository boilerplate (`AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE*`, …) is denied
**root-anchored**: the patterns match against the path relative to the project root and
carry no separator, so they can only match a top-level path. Matching them as bare
basenames at any depth destroys real documents — measured deleting
`docs/kiro-cli/mcp/security.md` and `docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`. This is the
single most likely way to ship a silently-wrong filter.

**Project documents (`project_docs.py`).** Each live chat slot's project dir resolves to
its nearest `.git` ancestor and is registered as an `active` `local_folder` source
carrying the document filter. Deliberately NOT the recent-projects list — that includes
directories the user merely picked once. A repo root that resolves to the user's home
directory is refused: a dotfiles repo in `$HOME` would otherwise make any project dir
under it register the whole home directory.

No confirmation step. The manual folder-add path uses `pending_confirmation` because an
unfiltered folder walk is unbounded; the filter plus the budget makes it bounded, so the
gate is unnecessary rather than skipped. Dismissal is after-the-fact instead: deleting
the source writes a `dismissed_auto_sources` tombstone that survives the delete.

Containment is re-validated every sweep, but on a different invariant from the drop
folder: a project repo root lives OUTSIDE the workspace by design, so
`project_source_still_valid` checks that the recorded path still resolves to itself (it
did at registration, so a divergence means the directory was swapped for a link
elsewhere) and is still a non-sensitive directory. Applying workspace containment to
both would skip every project source with a `denied` audit event.

Containment also applies per FILE, via the `confine_to_root` source property: a file
whose resolved path lands outside the registered root is skipped. `os.walk` does not
descend a directory symlink, but a file symlink IS followed on open, so a repository
containing `docs/runbook.md -> ../../private/runbook.md` would otherwise get that
external file indexed and LLM-extracted. The property is off for a folder the user
registered by hand -- following a link they placed there is their choice -- and on for
an auto-registered source, where nobody confirmed the scope.

**Agent-added documents (`agent_source.py`).** The `knowledge_add_document` MCP tool
lands documents in one aggregate `agent://` source named "Auto-added", with per-document
groups in `agent_item_state` keyed by a slug derived from the document's `source_uri` and
never from its content, so an edit replaces the group rather than accumulating copies. The
identity must not be the title alone: two unrelated documents are both routinely called
"README", and since a matching key means "same document, replace it", a title-keyed group
lets the second add delete the first document's items. It routes
through `IngestionPipeline.ingest_file` — one ingestion path — and content and title are
redacted before they cross into the store. Adds are serialised by a module lock, because
new items are attributed to a document by diffing the source's item ids around the
ingest.

The tool takes the document TEXT and **never opens a file**. A path opened here on
behalf of whatever supplied it is exactly the case where a component can be swapped for a
link to a credential file between the check and the open, and a path pointing at a binary
crashes the decode. Text the agent has already read carries no such window: it was read
through the agent's own file tools, under their approval and audit. Documents that
arrive fetched are text to begin with, and documents in the user's project are covered
by project-docs registration, which scans through the guarded folder path.

`source_uri` is an **opaque identity label**, not a read instruction: it is redacted,
capped, stored and hashed, and never opened, resolved, stat-ed or fetched. It is
**required**, because a title does not identify a document. The identity is hashed from
the RAW uri while only the redacted form is stored or audited — redaction is lossy, so two
uris differing only in a same-length credential-shaped segment reduce to the same string,
and hashing that would merge two documents into one group. A caller needing the bytes at
that location reads them itself and passes `content`.

This replaces the never-built server-side doc-link scanner. Rather than Kiro Crew
regex-matching links in chat and fetching them unattended, the agent reads the document
with its own tools under its own approval and hands over text. Kiro Crew fetches nothing,
so `knowledge.doc_ingest_hosts` — whose default is `[]` = deny-all — must NOT gate this
path, or the feature would ingest nothing on a default config while its toggle read on.

**Chunk budget.** `folder_watcher._do_scan` orders discovered files newest-first
unconditionally and stops once a sweep has ingested its budget of chunks. Files not
reached keep (or lack) their `folder_file_state` row, so the next sweep resumes from
them — the existing `status` column already carries the resume point. Every folder
source is budgeted: `knowledge.auto_ingest_chunk_budget` for an auto-registered one,
`knowledge.folder_ingest_chunk_budget` (resolved by `folder_watcher.folder_chunk_budget`,
overridable per source via a `chunk_budget` property, 0 = unbounded) for one the user
added by hand. A hand-added folder still gets ingested in full; the budget only decides
how fast. It applies to the confirm- and resume-triggered scans as well as the sweep,
because the confirm scan is the largest burst — nothing is ingested yet, so every
discovered file is new.

**Cost visibility.** `POST /api/knowledge/sources` walks a folder before ingesting
anything and returns `file_count`, `capped_file_count`, `estimated_chunks`,
`estimated_llm_calls` and `chunk_budget_per_sweep` alongside the
`pending_confirmation` status. The walk uses `folder_watcher.walk_filters`, the same
filter set the sweep applies, so the count describes the files that would actually be
ingested. The chunk figure is derived from the chunker's target size and file bytes
(`_estimated_chunks`), never measured: it exists to show order of magnitude before the
user confirms, and no code path treats it as a bound.

## 3. LLMPool workers (`llm_pool.py`)

Both entity extraction (`EntityExtractor`) and internal-URL fetch (`agent_fetch.fetch_url_content`) acquire workers from a shared `LLMPool` — a provider-agnostic, bounded pool (`DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE` = 3) of **long-lived** ACP workers. A `Worker` ABC has two concrete paths:

- **Default (kiro-cli)** — `AcpWorker` drives the `kirocrew-knowledge` agent over ACP (`AGENT_NAME`). That agent is installed by `agent.py:_install_knowledge_agent` (model `claude-haiku-4.5`, kirocrew-core tools only — no internal MCP wiring in the OSS fork).
- **`agent.provider="claude_code"` (legacy seam)** — `CCWorker` drives a long-lived `claude` CLI subprocess over stream-json I/O (haiku model, `bypassPermissions`); URL-fetch tools are opt-in via `KIROCREW_KNOWLEDGE_FETCH_TOOLS`. KiroCrew's provider enum is `["acp"]`, so this branch is dormant in practice.

### Sweep shielding + audit source

`AcpWorker.start()` wires two protections that matter for a long-lived pool worker (`llm_pool.py`):

- **Sweep shielding via `register_protected_pid`** — pool workers are direct `AcpClient` sessions, **not** `SessionMap` sessions or warm-pool providers, so the gateway's periodic orphan sweep cannot see them via `_collect_active_pids` and would SIGKILL a *busy* worker mid-task (surfacing as `ACP process exited (code=1)`). After `ensure_ready()`, `AcpWorker` registers the worker's kiro-cli PID in the sweep-protected set via `register_protected_pid` (`session_pid.py`), and unregisters it in `shutdown()` and on respawn — so the orphan sweep treats it like a live session (the same `register_protected_pid` mechanism the shared `WorkerPool` engine in `acp/worker_pool.py` applies to `ReviewPool`'s `AcpReviewWorker`).
- **`audit_source="subagent"`** — pool workers run tools without passing through `chat_runner` or `SubagentManager`, so their tool calls would otherwise never reach the security audit log. With `audit_source` set, `AcpClient` emits an SEL `log_tool_invocation` record (`source="subagent"`, `outcome="auto_approved"`) per auto-approved tool call; the emit is offloaded to `subprocess_executor()` and bounded by `asyncio.wait_for` so a hung SEL backend never stalls tool dispatch. `None` (chat/subagent clients) never double-logs.

### Sandbox parity

`_get_sandbox_mode()` reads `agent.sandbox` (default `"off"` → defers isolation to kiro-cli's internal agent sandbox; set `"auto"` for standard OS-level confinement). It distinguishes two fallback cases so a config error can never silently disable sandboxing: an **absent** value defaults to `"off"` (the intended default), while a **present but unrecognised** value falls back to `"auto"` (fail-secure) rather than reaching `wrap_argv` as an unknown mode. Knowledge workers honour the same `agent.sandbox` setting as chat/Slack providers (parity), so the default flows through here too.

### Pool mechanics

`LLMPool.start()` reads config once off the event loop and spawns all workers; `acquire()` blocks on a semaphore when all workers are busy and transparently replaces a dead worker (`is_alive()` false) on acquire. `send()` is the acquire→send→release convenience; `send_batch()` runs prompts concurrently bounded by pool size. A failed spawn during `start()` tears down all already-started workers.

**Untrusted-chunk delimiters (CWE-94).** `EntityExtractor` wraps each untrusted chunk in **per-request nonce-suffixed** delimiters (`<<<BEGIN_UNTRUSTED_CHUNK_{nonce}>>>` / `<<<END_UNTRUSTED_CHUNK_{nonce}>>>`, `nonce = uuid4().hex`), so content that embeds a legacy static delimiter cannot forge the boundary and inject instructions. Both `extract` (single) and `extract_batch` (the ingestion path) apply this, and the batch path mints a **distinct nonce per chunk**.

## 4. FTS5 + graph + vector retrieval (`retrieval.py`, `store.py`)

`HybridRetriever.search(query, limit)` runs three legs and fuses them with Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

**Store (`KnowledgeStore`, `store.py`)** — SQLite (prefers `pysqlite3`, falls back to stdlib `sqlite3`), WAL journal, `foreign_keys=ON`. Items live in `items` (with an `embedding BLOB` and `status`), keyword search is served by the FTS5 virtual table `items_fts(title, content, tags, content=items, content_rowid=rowid)`, and the entity graph is an in-memory `SimpleDiGraph` (a minimal networkx-free replacement). The store keeps `items_fts` in sync on every insert/update/delete of the FTS-backed columns.

- **Keyword leg (`_keyword_search`)** — FTS5 `MATCH` over `items_fts`, ordered by `rank`. `_sanitize_fts5_query` double-quotes each token (doubling internal quotes) so user input never contributes FTS5 operators (parameterized quoting), drops `_STOPWORDS`, and OR-joins the remainder so a natural-language query no longer requires every literal token to match. An all-stopword query falls back to the raw tokens rather than dropping the leg.
- **Graph leg (`_graph_search`)** — resolves query words and adjacent word-pairs to entities, expands via graph neighbors (depth 2), and ranks items by mention count.
- **Vector leg (`_vector_search`)** — brute-force cosine over `items` with `embedding IS NOT NULL AND status='active'`; returns `None` when no embedder is wired. Items whose stored embedding dimension differs from the query vector are **skipped** (not scored 0.0), with a single per-search WARNING so a model swap / stale index surfaces as "re-index needed". `_cosine_similarity` returns 0.0 for differing-length or zero vectors.
- **RRF fusion (`_rrf_fuse`, k=60)** — per-leg weights align positionally with `(keyword, graph, vector) = (1.0, 1.0, VECTOR_RRF_WEIGHT=2.0)` so semantically-strong matches dominate when the keyword leg returns literal junk. Results are tie-broken by recency (`updated_at`), and each result's `match_type` records which legs it appeared in (`keyword+graph+vector`).

**Citation enrichment** — `_attach_source_locations` batch-fetches `source_locations` (adds `section_title`, `chunk_range`, `anchor`); `_attach_citation_sources` adds `source_type`/`source_name`/`source_uri` plus the most specific per-document locator: `file_path` for folder/vault sources (from `folder_file_state`), `artifact_slug`/`artifact_name` for the aggregate artifact source (deep-links `/artifacts/<slug>`). Missing/unmapped sources degrade cleanly (extra keys simply absent).

### `local_knowledge_search` MCP tool (`mcp_core.py`)

The LLM reaches retrieval through the `kirocrew-core` MCP tool `local_knowledge_search`:
- DB path: `config_dir()/workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`; a missing DB returns "Knowledge Library is not configured…" (SEL `not_configured`).
- `_get_knowledge_search` caches the `(KnowledgeStore, embedder)` pair across calls and rebuilds only when the knowledge DB (or its `-wal`) or `config.json` changes — avoiding the per-call schema DDL / migrate / graph-load and the Ollama availability probe.
- Default `limit` is 3; results below `min_score = 0.012` are dropped. Output is run through `redact_exfiltration_urls()` + `redact_credentials()` before returning, and every call emits an SEL audit event (`success` / `no_results` / `not_configured`). Input is validated against `LOCAL_KNOWLEDGE_SEARCH_SCHEMA` (`validation.py`).
- **The response is written through a private stdout descriptor, not fd 1.** The first search's availability probe (`InProcessEmbedder.is_available` → `embed`) kicks the background GGUF load, and the vendored llama-cpp wraps that load in `suppress_stdout_stderr`, which `dup2`s **fd 1 process-wide to `/dev/null`** for the duration (~0.7s) *and* rebinds the `sys.stdout` object. Because the probe returns `None` immediately, the search answers keyword-only in milliseconds — so its JSON-RPC response raced that window and was silently destroyed: no exception, no short write, SEL still logging `success`, and the client hanging until the ACP tool-stall watchdog (`acp/client.py::_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT`, 600s) killed the turn. `mcp_shared.run_mcp_stdio_loop` now takes an `os.dup(1)` snapshot (`snapshot_stdout_fd`) at server startup before any tool can run, and `respond()` writes through it under a lock, so responses (and `ping` / `tools/list` replies, which were equally exposed) always reach the client. Falls back to `sys.stdout` when stdout is not fd-backed. Note that "has `sys.stdout` been swapped?" is *not* a usable guard — the suppressor swaps the object too, so it reads as swapped exactly inside the window that must be survived.

The dashboard Knowledge tab uses the same store via a lazily-initialized `KnowledgeStore` on `DashboardState` (`dashboard/state.py`).

## 5. Source-scoped list API (`dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py`)

The dashboard Knowledge list view is **source-first**: it renders one collapsed
row per source and pages *within* a source, rather than paging all items globally
and grouping whatever landed on the page. Two pieces of API surface support this.

### `GET /api/knowledge/items?source_id=<id>`

Scopes the page to a single source. Composes with the existing `type`, `status`,
`namespace`, `q`, `page`, and `limit` params.

- The reported `total` is **scoped to that source**, not the global count. The
  in-group pager derives its page count from it, so a global total would break
  the pager math.
- `source_id=__none__` selects items with no source (`source_id` NULL or empty).
- Applied in both branches of `list_items`: as a SQL predicate in the list
  branch, and via `_matches_source` after ranking in the hybrid-search branch.
- Because the hybrid-search branch filters *after* the retriever has ranked
  globally, a scoped search escalates its candidate pool
  (`_search_until_exhausted`: `_SCOPED_SEARCH_START` doubling to
  `_SCOPED_SEARCH_MAX`) until the retriever short-reads, so the scoped total is
  exact rather than truncated by a fixed window. At the cap the total may
  understate; pushing `source_id` into `HybridRetriever` is the tracked
  follow-up. Unscoped searches keep the cheap `limit * 3` window.

### `GET /api/knowledge/source-counts`

Returns the item count per source **under the active filters**:

```json
{ "counts": { "<source_id>": 42, "__none__": 3 }, "total": 45 }
```

- Accepts `type`, `status`, and `namespace`; the counts reflect them, which is
  why the list view uses this rather than `/sources.item_count` (a source's
  unfiltered, all-namespace total that would over-report when filtered).
- Sourceless items are reported under the `__none__` key.
- The list view derives its rows from these counts, which is what guarantees
  every source is visible at once regardless of relative size.

## Invariants

- **Sensitive paths never ingested** — `FileReader.read`, `FolderWatcher._walk`, `_hash_file`, and `_ingest_file` all gate on `is_sensitive_path()` (with symlink re-resolution at ingest time for TOCTOU).
- **`.org` and unknown-but-supported extensions are plain text** — only `_DISPATCH` extensions get specialized readers; everything else in `SUPPORTED` flows through `_read_text` → generic chunker.
- **Pool workers are long-lived and must be sweep-shielded** — any direct `AcpClient` worker that outlives a chat turn (not tracked in `SessionMap`/warm pool) must register its PID via `register_protected_pid`, or the orphan sweep will kill it mid-task.
- **LLM-derived text is redacted before storage and before return** — ingestion redacts extracted text (`ingestion._redact`), and `local_knowledge_search` redacts its assembled output.
- **FTS query input is parameterized** — user query tokens are always double-quoted literals; the user never injects FTS5 operators.
- **Embedding-dimension mismatches are skipped, not scored** — vector search excludes incomparable-dimension items so a model swap cannot fill the top-K with all-zero ghosts.
- **The self-heal rebuild path never touches SQLite on the event loop** — `_maybe_reembed_stale`'s stale COUNT, `rebuild_embeddings`' total COUNT / page SELECTs / batch progress commits, and the success-path job finalize all run via `asyncio.to_thread` (`store.db` is a per-thread connection, so each worker thread uses its own connection to the same WAL db). On a large KB (observed: ~1.3GB after an embedder-sig change) an inline COUNT can stall past the 25s loop-watchdog threshold and crash-loop the gateway. The one deliberate exception is the CancelledError finalize in `_run_reembed_job`, which stays inline so cancellation cannot pre-empt the single-flight finalize. When the stale count exceeds `_LARGE_REBUILD_WARN_THRESHOLD` the watcher logs a prominent WARNING before starting the full re-embed.
- **`__none__` is a shared wire contract** — the no-source sentinel is defined as `_NO_SOURCE` in `dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py` and mirrored as `NO_SOURCE` in `website/src/pages/knowledge/SourceGroup.tsx`. Both sides must change together; it is effectively un-renameable once shipped.
- **A source-scoped `total` is scoped, never global** — `/items?source_id=` reports the count for that source alone, because the per-source pager computes its page count from it.
- **Per-source badge counts are filter-aware** — list-view badges come from `/source-counts` (which honours `type`/`status`/`namespace`), not from `/sources.item_count`, so a badge never disagrees with the group's contents under a filter.
- **The search branch's candidate load runs off the event loop** — a scoped search escalates its candidate pool, so `_load_items_by_id` (batch `SELECT` plus per-row serialization) and the `source_counts` aggregate both run via `asyncio.to_thread`. `store.db` is a per-thread connection, so each worker thread uses its own. Run inline, either can stall the loop past the watchdog threshold on a large KB.
- **Frontend selection is bounded to on-screen items** — in source-first mode item data lives in per-`SourceGroup` caches, so bulk actions read the items each expanded group reports as rendered, and selected IDs are pruned when a group collapses or pages away. Reading the react-query cache directly would let a bulk Delete reach a retained cache for a source the user can no longer see.
- **Per-source caches are keyed under the `knowledge-items` prefix** — `['knowledge-items', 'source-items', ...]` and `['knowledge-items', 'source-counts', ...]` so every existing `invalidateQueries(['knowledge-items'])` call site reaches them. Consequently any `setQueriesData` on that prefix must guard on the payload shape, since the counts entry has no `items` array.
