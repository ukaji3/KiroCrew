# ACP Client Module

## Overview

The ACP layer spans **five** modules: the legacy per-session client (`acp/client.py`, one subprocess per session), the multiplexed runtime (`acp/runtime.py`, one subprocess fanned out to N sessions), the per-session handle (`acp/session_handle.py`, one `sessionId` + queue + prompt/approve/reject loop), a shared dispatch parser (`acp/_dispatch.py`, pure frame-shaping/redaction helpers all paths route through), and the session provider (`acp/session_provider.py`, `AcpSessionProvider` adapting an `AcpSessionHandle` to the `LLMProvider` ABC so runtime-backed sessions are interchangeable with `AcpClient`). All are JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio for `kiro-cli acp` or `claude-agent-acp`, managing subprocess lifecycle, session initialization, prompt streaming, and tool permissions. All protocol constants in `acp/types.py`.

## Backend Selection

`AcpClient(acp_backend=...)` selects which subprocess to launch:

- `""` (default): `kiro-cli acp --agent <name>` (resolved by `_resolve_kiro_bin`). Per-session kiro settings are layered in via the workspace overlay `<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json` (written by `AcpProvider`, not the client): reasoning **effort** (`chat.modelDefaults`) and **MCP Tool Search** (`toolSearch.enabled` + zeroed thresholds, gated by `agent.tool_search`, default on) — see providers.md.
- `"claude"` (`ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`): `claude-agent-acp` (resolved by `_resolve_claude_acp_bin` → `list[str] | None`). Resolution order: `CLAUDE_AGENT_ACP_BIN` env var, then the **vendored copy** (`_resolve_vendored_claude_acp` — `<node_modules>/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp/dist/index.js` found under the package's `_vendor/node_modules` from the distribution bundle, the sibling `KiroCrewWebsite/node_modules` in a source checkout, or `KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR`; needs no global npm install or network — matters on hosts that have no package-registry token at gateway runtime), then `mise which claude-agent-acp` (respects MISE_DATA_DIR and all mise config), then `~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/*/bin/claude-agent-acp` (direct glob fallback), then augmented PATH (`env.augmented_path` — mise shims, `~/.npm-packages/bin`, `~/.volta/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, plus globbed nvm/fnm node bins via `_node_version_manager_bins`, so a non-login launchd/systemd gateway also finds globally-installed binaries). The adapter is vendored into the distribution bundle and the pip build by `setup.py` (`_vendor_acp_into_pkg` → `kiro_crew/_vendor/node_modules`), so every install method ships it without asking the user to `npm i -g`. Vendoring copies the adapter **plus its full transitive dependency closure** (`_acp_dependency_closure` walks `dependencies`/`optionalDependencies` from the resolved website `node_modules`, ~96 flat top-level packages) — npm hoists deps like `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` flat, so copying only the adapter package crashes the ESM loader with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. `_resolve_vendored_claude_acp` accepts a root only when the hoisted dependency marker `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` is present alongside the entry, so an incomplete vendored copy is skipped in favour of a complete one instead of being spawned and crashed. For scripts under mise installs, returns `[node_binary, script_path]` to bypass `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang resolution which fails in non-interactive daemon contexts. For standalone binaries, returns `[binary_path]`. Pre-spawn the client writes `<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json` with `defaultMode: default` so the adapter routes every tool decision back to KiroCrew via `session/request_permission`. This makes claude-agent-acp participate in the same approve / trust_reads / trust / yolo protocol as kiro-cli — dashboard, subagents, channel agents, cron, and heartbeat all share the path. KiroCrew still enforces per-tool security via `HooksConfig.auto_deny_tools` (evaluated by `HookManager.on_tool_call` in `hooks.py`) on every `session/request_permission` event. The subprocess env also carries `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<config_dir>/cc-config` (isolated config root, distinct from the project-scope `<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json` which stays) so the adapter's `SettingsManager` and the SDK read KiroCrew's seeded settings (creds/models kept, plugins stripped) instead of the user's global `~/.claude` — see claude-code-provider.md "Config Isolation" (the "Standalone provider — removed" record). Disable via `KIROCREW_CC_ISOLATE=0`. The env also carries `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` (claude backend only, set in `_spawn` when unset): the adapter delegates the model turn to `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, which needs a per-platform native Claude binary (~250 MB each) shipped as npm `optionalDependencies` that the website install omits — so the vendored closure does **not** include it and the SDK fails `session/new` with `Claude native binary not found for <platform>`. The SDK does **not** search PATH for `claude` itself (so the host merely having the external agent CLI installed is not enough), and bundling a quarter-GB binary per platform is not viable; instead `_resolve_claude_code_executable` finds an existing `claude` (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` override → `mise which claude` → augmented PATH incl. `~/.toolbox/bin`, where a managed distribution may ship the external agent CLI) and the adapter forwards it to the SDK as `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` (no version check). If none is found the var is left unset (with a warning) so the adapter's native-binary error surfaces rather than a guessed bad path; an explicit operator-set value always wins.

**Kiro executable resolution at spawn.** Trust is "the CLI runs": any resolvable
executable Kiro CLI launches for ACP, regardless of install source, owner, or
fixed path — KiroCrew is not the authority on where Kiro CLI is installed, and
Kiro CLI's own self-updater legitimately rewrites its bytes as the user, so an
install-source/owner/path/codesign gate would strand real installs (toolbox,
Homebrew, winget, a self-updated `/Applications` bundle) with no recovery path.
`snapshot_trusted_acp_executable` refuses only a non-runnable candidate and
returns the resolved path; `TrustedAcpExecutableSnapshot` now carries just
`launch_path`.

**The CLI is always launched IN PLACE — never from a copy.** KiroCrew execs the
binary at the path it resolved, on every platform. This is a hard requirement,
not a preference:

- **Kiro CLI 2.15+ is a multi-call binary.** It dispatches subcommands by
  exec'ing a SIBLING executable (e.g. `kiro-cli-chat`) that it locates relative
  to its own executable path — on macOS by finding `.app/Contents/MacOS/` in that
  path. Copying the binary into a flat private directory strands the sibling, so
  every dispatch fails with `No such file or directory (os error 2)` and ACP dies
  at the handshake with `process exited (rc=None)`.
- The same breaks any launcher that resolves adjacent resources: a multiplexer
  dispatching on `argv[0]` (`~/.toolbox/bin/kiro-cli` → `toolbox-exec`), a
  wrapper reading a sibling registry, or a self-updating install whose real
  payload lives beside it. The launch path is therefore the path the caller
  resolved, **not** its realpath.

**Removed: the resolve-to-exec integrity snapshot.** An earlier design copied the
resolved bytes into a private location and executed that instead — a sealed
`MFD_ALLOW_SEALING | MFD_EXEC` memfd on Linux (executed as `/proc/self/fd/<fd>`),
a verified copy under `<data-home>/run/kiro-cli-snapshots` on macOS (and on Linux
interpreters lacking `os.memfd_create`) — so a binary swapped between resolve and
exec could not reach the running process. That is **deliberately gone**, along
with the descriptor registry, `pass_fds` inheritance, the off-loop
close/unlink cleanup, and `platform_compat.seal_memfd`.

The rationale: the threat it closed is an attacker who already has write access
to the user's own machine, which the rest of the product does not defend against
either — while the cost was breaking every multi-call and multiplexer install
outright. Do NOT reintroduce a copy-then-exec strategy for the Kiro CLI. The
spawn still passes an explicit `is_kiro_cli` classification to `wrap_argv`, so
macOS internal-sandbox delegation never depended on a private launch-path
basename. Resolution runs off the event loop (`asyncio.to_thread`, shielded so a
cancelled caller still lets the worker settle).

## Tool Permission Protocol

`session/request_permission` is the single inbound channel. The agent sends:

```jsonc
{ "method": "session/request_permission",
  "params": { "sessionId": "...", "options": [PermissionOption], "toolCall": ToolCallUpdate } }
```

**Unknown server→client requests are answered, never dropped.** `session/request_permission` is the only inbound *request* KiroCrew implements. Any other server→client request (method **and** id — e.g. `fs/read_text_file`, `terminal/create`) is classified by `_process_message` as `"server_request_unknown"`. Every prompt dispatch site (`send_message_stream`, `_dispatch_events`, `_read_prompt_response`) handles that action by calling `_reject_unknown_server_request`, which replies with a JSON-RPC `-32601` (`_JSONRPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND`, "Method not found") error via `_send_error`. Without this, JSON-RPC semantics leave the agent blocked forever on an unanswered request — the turn hangs. Notifications (method, no id) are unaffected and still classified `"skip"`.

`PermissionOption` field names differ between backends — kiro-cli uses `id`/`label`, claude-agent-acp uses `optionId`/`name` (per the public ACP spec). `_build_permission_event` reads both and remembers the optionIds keyed by `kind` (`allow_once`/`allow_always`/`reject_once`/`reject_always`) on the request id — recording an entry when **either** an allow option (for `approve_tool`) **or** a reject option (for a clean `reject_tool`) was advertised. `approve_tool(request_id, *, always=False)` echoes the matching allow id back, so the host doesn't need to know whether it's talking to kiro (`"allow_once"`/`"allow_always"`) or claude-agent-acp (`"allow"`/`"allow_always"`). `reject_tool` prefers a **clean reject**: if a reject optionId was advertised it sends `outcome: "selected"` with that id (claude-agent-acp's `reject` → `behavior: "deny"`); otherwise it falls back to `outcome: "cancelled"` (kiro-cli, which handles it as an ordinary rejection). This matters because the claude-agent-acp adapter throws `Error("Tool use aborted")` on a `cancelled` outcome — so a host-side deny that sent `cancelled` surfaced to the user as a cryptic "Tool use aborted" with no prompt; the clean reject yields an explainable denial instead.

The host always sends one-shot approvals (`always=False`, the default). KiroCrew — not the agent — owns the trust scope (`slot._trust`, `slot._trust_reads`, `slot._trusted_patterns`, `safety_override`, `channel.trusted`, parent session `approval_policy`). Per-call `session/request_permission` is required so KiroCrew's PreToolUse hooks (`auto_deny_tools`, sensitive-path checks, credential redaction) fire on every tool invocation. The `always=True` path is reserved for a future "skip KiroCrew hooks for this exact tool" feature; no caller passes it today.

The handshake also branches on the backend:

- `protocolVersion` in the `initialize` request: kiro-cli expects the date string `"2025-08-22"`; claude-agent-acp expects an integer (`1`, per the upstream ACP SDK schema).
- claude skips `session/set_mode` and uses `session/set_config_option` (configId `model`) instead of `session/set_model`.

Sending the wrong shape yields `-32602 Invalid params` or `-32601 Method not found`.

**`clientCapabilities` in the `initialize` request.** Both transports (`AcpClient._initialize_session` and `AcpRuntime`) send the shared `ACP_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` dict from `acp/types.py`. Previously the key was omitted entirely, so the agent assumed the all-false default.

| Key | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `fs.readTextFile` / `fs.writeTextFile` | `false` | We serve no `fs/*` handler; advertising them would invite requests that hit `_reject_unknown_server_request`. |
| `terminal` | `false` | Same — the agent uses its own tools. |
| `elicitation` | `{form: {}, url: {}}` | **Forward-bet.** kiro-cli 2.14.0 compiles the `elicitation/create` schema (form + url modes, `requestedSchema` with `enum`/`oneOf` single-select and array multi-select) and gates it on this capability, but does **not** yet route an MCP server's `elicitation/create` out over ACP — a stub MCP server issuing one gets `-32601 method not found`. Declaring it costs nothing today and makes the richer native prompt available the moment upstream ships the bridge. **Consequence to accept:** once the bridge lands, inbound `elicitation/create` requests will be rejected by `_reject_unknown_server_request` until a handler is wired — the same failure mode as today, but then attributable to us rather than upstream.

**Request-id namespaces are independent.** Our outbound requests (prompt, initialize, set_model, ...) use `_next_req_id()`; the agent's inbound server→client requests (`session/request_permission`) carry their own id counter. The two collide on small integers, so `JsonRpcMessage.is_response_for(req_id)` requires both `id == req_id` **and** `method is None` — a response never has a `method`. Without the `method is None` guard, a permission request whose id equals the in-flight prompt's `req_id` was misclassified as that prompt's completion in `_process_message`, ending the turn early and leaving the tool's permission unanswered → the agent turn hangs on follow-up messages (the agent waits forever for a `session/request_permission` response that never comes).

This same method-aware discipline is enforced in `_wait_for_response()`. While it awaits a specific `req_id`, an inbound server→client **request** (method + id — e.g. a colliding `session/request_permission`) or a **foreign-id response** (id ≠ req_id, no method) must not be misread as the awaited response, must not be dropped, and must not be re-appended to `self._buffer` and `continue`-d. The last is the critical hazard: `_read_message()` pops `self._buffer` first, so re-buffering + looping immediately re-reads the same frame and **spins until the deadline** (the original bug — stuck `init`/`load`/`set_config_option` ending in `AcpTimeoutError`). Instead, non-matching survivable frames are collected into a **local `deferred` list** and re-injected at the **front** of `self._buffer` *in arrival order* once the matching response arrives (or on timeout/shutdown), so a later `_prompt_loop`/`_process_message` can still answer a deferred permission request. Notifications (method, no id) continue to go to `_mcp_notifications` for `_drain_notifications`.

### Removed agent-renderer translation (cc_agent.py, deleted)

When the removed agent renderer generated its agent artifacts, `cc_agent.py` translated kiro-native field names to the removed provider's equivalents using module-level translation tables:

- `_KIRO_TO_CC_TOOL_NAME` — maps kiro tool names (`fs_read`, `execute_bash`, `shell`, `code`, etc.) to the removed provider's names (`Read`, `Bash`, `Edit`, etc.). `@server` prefix becomes `mcp__server`. `use_aws` is dropped (no equivalent).
- `_KIRO_TO_CC_HOOK_EVENT` — maps kiro hook events (lowerCamel: `preToolUse`, `agentSpawn`) to the removed provider's hook events (PascalCase: `PreToolUse`, `SessionStart`).
- `_translate_matcher(glob)` — converts kiro glob matchers to the removed provider's regex matchers (escapes regex metacharacters, `*` becomes `.*`, `?` becomes `.`).

MCP server fields translated: `disabled: true` entries are omitted; `autoApprove: [tool]` maps to `mcp__<server>__<tool>` in settings allow-list; `disabledTools: [tool]` maps to agent-level `disallowedTools`.

## Agent Configuration

Data-driven — no code changes needed:
- `config/defaults.json` — base config (tools, model, permissions), resolved via `_BUNDLED_CFG_DIR` in `agent.py`
- `config/prompt.md` — system prompt, resolved via `_BUNDLED_CFG_DIR` in `agent.py`
- `~/.kiro/crew/agent.json` — user overrides (optional)
- Run `kirocrew setup --agent-only` after editing

Note: there IS a top-level `agents/` directory used at runtime for project-level overrides, but the bundled source lives in `src/kiro_crew/config/`.

Default model: `claude-opus-4.8`. Default tools: `execute_bash`, `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `code`, `grep`, `glob`, `use_aws`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `introspect`, `session`, `report`, `@kirocrew-cron`, `@kirocrew-core`.

**Security enforcement** (`agent.py`): `repair_agent_configs()` is the single entry point (called at install, gateway startup, and periodically ~60s). It runs two passes:

1. `_enforce_denied_commands()` — injects bundled `deniedCommands` patterns into ALL agent configs in `~/.kiro/agents/` (not just kirocrew). Uses mtime to skip unchanged files. Replaces the agent's denied commands entirely with bundled defaults (canonical source; user-added patterns via dashboard are not supported). Targets both `execute_bash` and `shell` tool settings.
2. `_sanitize_agent_hooks()` — strips invalid hook keys from agent configs. Kiro-cli 2.4.2+ rejects unknown variants in the `hooks` field (e.g. `auto_approve_tools`), causing silent fallback to the default agent which loses the internal MCP server, kirocrew-core, kirocrew-cron. `_kiro_hooks_only()` filters to valid events (`preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `userPromptSubmit`, `agentSpawn`, `stop`). Also uses mtime-based caching to skip unchanged files. Bundled `auto_approve_tools` patterns are now applied at runtime in the hooks layer (`_BUNDLED_AUTO_APPROVE_TOOLS` in `hooks.py`) rather than being serialized to the config file.

## Custom Agent Support

Custom agents (AIM-installed or user-created) are fully supported. The `--agent`
flag passed to `kiro-cli acp` at spawn time drives all configuration:

- **Model**: `set_model` is skipped for custom agents — kiro-cli uses the
  agent's own `model` field. Only the default kirocrew agent gets KiroCrew's
  configured model override.
- **MCP servers**: backend-dependent.
  - **kiro-cli**: `session/new` passes `mcpServers: []` — kiro-cli loads
    servers from the agent config (respects `mcpServers` in the agent's config
    file). Non-kirocrew agents (e.g. AIM-installed) load only their own
    `mcpServers`. The kirocrew agent loads from global `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
    where `disabled` and `disabledTools` flags are respected. KiroCrew's dashboard
    MCP tab writes directly to the global config.
  - **claude-agent-acp**: does NOT read any config file or `--agent` flag, so
    `session/new` (and `session/load`) must carry the servers in the
    `mcpServers` param. `_claude_acp_mcp_servers()` reads the KiroCrew-owned
    `~/.claude/agents/kirocrew.mcp.json` (kept current by
    `agent.install_cc_agent_config`) and reshapes it to the ACP array via
    `cc_agent.acp_servers_from_cc_map` (stdio → `{name,command,args,env:[{name,value}],type}`;
    url → `{name,type:"http"|"sse",url,headers}`). kirocrew-core/cron are forced
    to their canonical stdio command (overriding any stale `url`) and always
    injected even when the registry is missing. Read per spawn so MCP
    installs/toggles apply on the next session without a gateway restart.
- **Tools/allowedTools/toolsSettings**: Applied by kiro-cli via `set_mode`.
- **Prompt/resources/hooks**: Applied by kiro-cli via `set_mode`.
- **deniedCommands**: Enforced by KiroCrew's `_enforce_denied_commands()` on
  all agent configs regardless.

Custom agents use cold start with `--agent <name>` flag at spawn time.

## Protocol Flow

`initialize` → `session/load` or `session/new` → `set_mode` (conditional) → `set_model` (conditional) → drain notifications → `session/prompt`

`ensure_ready()` re-creates `_work_dir` on every call (idempotent `mkdir -p`) so
that prompts still succeed if the directory was deleted externally between
calls. kiro-cli's spawned shell inherits the client's cwd and does not revalidate
it per-command.

Steps 1–2 (`initialize`, `session/load` or `session/new`) block until a JSON-RPC
response arrives (base 240s) because the session ID is required before proceeding.
If the first attempt times out, `ensure_ready()` kills the process and retries once
with a fresh spawn — this handles slow kiro-cli first launches where MCP servers are
still initializing.  `_wait_for_response()` checks `shutdown_event` each iteration
so init aborts promptly on Ctrl+C instead of blocking for the full timeout.

**Activity-based deadline.** `_wait_for_response()`'s deadline is *not* a fixed
wall-clock. Every received frame (notification, deferred server request, or
foreign response) resets the deadline to `now + timeout`, bounded by an absolute
`_WAIT_RESPONSE_MAX_TIMEOUT` (600s) safety cap. This matters for `session/load`:
the adapter streams the ENTIRE prior transcript as `session/update`
**notifications** before resolving the load response, so a fixed deadline would
kill a long replay and silently fall back to `session/new`. Extending only while
the agent is actively sending data is safe for the init/handshake callers — the
hard cap still bounds a truly stuck handshake.

### Session Resume via `session/load`

When `set_resume_session_id(sid)` is called before `ensure_ready()`, the client
attempts `session/load` instead of `session/new`:

1. Check `agentCapabilities.loadSession` from `initialize` response
2. Verify `~/.kiro/sessions/cli/{sid}.json` exists on disk
3. Send `session/load` with `sessionId`, `cwd`, `mcpServers: []`, and
   `_meta: {"_kiro.dev/session_file": "<path>"}` (required — without it kiro-cli
   silently ignores the request)
4. On success (response contains `modes`): set `_session_id`, `_resumed = True`
5. On failure (JSON-RPC error, timeout, file missing): fall through to `session/new`

The resume ID is consumed on attempt (no retry loop). After successful load,
`client.resumed` returns `True` — callers use this to skip thread history injection.

Step 3 (`set_mode`) is **conditional**: sent for all kiro-cli backend agents.
Skipped for claude-agent-acp backend (which does not support set_mode).

Step 4 (`set_model`) is **conditional**: only sent when `model` is explicitly
set (i.e., for the default kirocrew agent).  Custom agents skip this so
kiro-cli uses the model from their own agent config file.

Step 5 drains MCP server init notifications (both after `session/load` and
`session/new` — loading a session triggers MCP re-initialization).

### Notification Buffering

`AcpClient._wait_for_response()` buffers all JSON-RPC notifications in
`_mcp_notifications` instead of discarding them. `_drain_notifications()`
processes buffered notifications first, then reads any remaining from stdout.

The multiplexed `AcpRuntime` has the same guarantee for session-scoped OAuth
requests even though it cannot register the session queue until `session/new`
or `session/load` returns the session id. While either request is in flight, the
runtime stages matching `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request` notifications in a bounded
buffer, transfers them into the new handle's queue once the id is known, and
`AcpSessionHandle.drain_init()` retains them for
`pop_pending_oauth_requests()`. Staging is cleared when the last concurrent init
finishes, including failure paths, so a stale approval URL cannot leak into a
later session.

## Key APIs

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ensure_ready()` | Spawn kiro-cli + init handshake (steps 1-5) |
| `send_message(msg)` | Full response text, auto-approves tools |
| `send_message_stream(msg)` | Yields text chunks, auto-approves (CLI) |
| `stream_events(msg)` | Yields `AcpEvent` objects, caller handles permissions (dashboard) |
| `approve_tool(id)` / `reject_tool(id)` | Tool permission responses |
| `send_command(cmd)` | Slash commands (e.g. `/compact`), returns response text |
| `cancel_session()` | Cancel in-flight operation |
| `wait_turn_done(timeout)` | Wait for the current prompt to finish; returns `stop_reason` or raises `asyncio.TimeoutError` |
| `has_active_turn()` | Returns `True` while a prompt is in flight and not yet complete |
| `shutdown()` | Kill kiro-cli process |

### Extension Notifications

`stream_events()` yields events for kiro-cli extension notifications:

| Notification | Event Kind | Fields |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` | `compaction_status` | `text` = started/completed/failed, `title` = summary |
| `_kiro.dev/clear/status` | `clear_status` | (none) |
| `_kiro.dev/agent/switched` | `agent_switched` | `text` = new agent name |
| `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request` | `mcp_oauth_request` | `server_name`, `oauth_url` |
| `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_initialized` | `mcp_server_initialized` | `server_name` |
| `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_init_failure` | `mcp_server_init_failure` | `server_name`, `text` = error |

`_process_message()` classifies these as `"compaction"`, `"clear"`, `"agent_switched"`, `"mcp_oauth_request"`, `"mcp_server_initialized"`, `"mcp_server_init_failure"` actions.
Other methods (`send_message_stream`, `send_message`) log compaction but do not yield
clear/agent events (CLI/Slack paths handle these differently).

### MCP OAuth Inline Banner

When kiro-cli needs OAuth authentication for an MCP server, `AcpClient` surfaces the flow inline:

1. `_kiro.dev/mcp/oauth_request` — captured during `_drain_notifications()` (init) and `_prompt_loop()` (mid-session). Yields `EVENT_MCP_OAUTH_REQUEST` with `serverName` + `oauthUrl`. Frontend renders an Authorize banner; kiro-cli's local callback handles the OAuth redirect.
2. `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_initialized` — flips the banner to authenticated state. Clears the per-server dedupe entry so a future token expiry can re-prompt.
3. `_kiro.dev/mcp/server_init_failure` — flips the banner to failed state with the error string. Also clears dedupe so a retry surfaces a fresh banner.

**Dedupe**: Per-server dedupe via `_oauth_emitted_servers: set[str]` prevents kiro-cli's per-probe retries from spamming the user. Works across both buffered (init drain) and live (mid-session) paths. Cleared on new session.

**URL validation**: `_is_safe_oauth_url()` rejects non-http(s) schemes before dedupe — an unsafe URL doesn't consume the dedupe slot.

**Persistence**: Role-aware redaction (`_redact_meta_for_role`) preserves `oauth_url` for `mcp_oauth` messages so the Authorize link survives history rehydrate, while still scrubbing unsafe schemes on the read path.

**API**: `pop_pending_oauth_requests()` drains requests captured during init on
both `AcpClient` and `AcpSessionProvider` (called after `ensure_ready()`).

**Remote-gateway callback relay**: The Connections waiting card accepts the failed browser return address when the browser and gateway run on different machines. `POST /api/mcp/oauth/relay` sends that address from the gateway host to kiro-cli's local callback listener. The handler is intentionally not a generic proxy: it accepts only plain-HTTP IP-literal loopback URLs (`127.0.0.0/8` or `::1`) with an explicit port and exactly one non-empty `code` value; it rejects userinfo, fragments, hostnames, non-loopback addresses, oversized input, and does not follow redirects. The callback URL and authorization code are never logged or returned; SEL records only the provider slug and completed/failed outcome.

## Cancellation

`cancel_session()` sends a `session/cancel` JSON-RPC notification to kiro-cli's stdin. It is fire-and-forget — no response ID is awaited.

### stopReason Parsing

When the ACP agent acknowledges a cancel, the `session/prompt` response carries `result.stopReason`. `_dispatch_events` reads this field on `action == "complete"` and populates `AcpEvent.stop_reason`:

- `"cancelled"` — agent honored the cancel request (`STOP_REASON_CANCELLED`)
- `"end_turn"` — normal turn completion (`STOP_REASON_END_TURN`)
- `""` — field absent or not a dict result

### Cancel Grace Window

Setting `_cancelled = True` no longer short-circuits `_read_message`. Instead, a 10-second grace window (`_CANCEL_GRACE_SECS = 10.0`) allows the agent to deliver its `stopReason` acknowledgement. If no response arrives within the window, `_read_message` raises `AcpError("Cancel grace window exceeded; agent unresponsive")`. This preserves the escape hatch for broken agents without sabotaging cooperative cancels.

`_cancel_ts` is set to `time.monotonic()` inside `cancel_session()`.

### Tool-Interruption Auto-Complete

kiro-cli's built-in security filter can cancel tool calls before they execute (e.g.
when a bash command contains sensitive keywords).  When this happens kiro-cli emits an
`agent_message_chunk` with the exact text
`Tool uses were interrupted, waiting for the next user prompt` **and then goes idle
without sending a `session/prompt` response**.  Without special handling the caller
would wait for the full 2-hour prompt timeout.

All three prompt paths (`send_message_stream`, `_dispatch_events`, `_read_prompt_response`)
detect this marker (exact stripped match, not substring, to avoid false positives when
the model quotes the text in prose) and complete the turn immediately — `_dispatch_events`
also synthesizes a final `EVENT_COMPLETE` so dashboard and CLI callers using
`stream_events` exit cleanly.  The text itself is still yielded so the user sees what
happened, and a `tool_interrupted`-tagged SEL audit event is written for the security
log since kiro-cli's cancellation is a permission decision outside KiroCrew's control.

### Stale-turn gate (`AcpClient`)

After text has streamed (`_stale_eligible`), a turn whose stdout+stderr fall silent for `_STALE_TURN_TIMEOUT` (90s) is a candidate for "treat as complete". The bare wall-clock reap this once did false-positived on a genuinely-working-but-quiet backend (a long model generation, or a spawned build emitting nothing to the pipe), ending the turn and losing all subsequent output — the *capture*-side analogue of the same blunt-timeout defect the runtime path already fixed for tool-stall. `AcpClient` now **oracle-gates** the reap, converging onto the same `LivenessOracle` (`acp/liveness.py`) contract the shared-runtime path uses: on every silent read while `_stale_eligible`, `_consult_liveness_model_wait()` calls `oracle.check_model_wait(self._pid)` (offloaded to `subprocess_executor()` under a 10s `wait_for`; degrades to `VERDICT_UNKNOWN` on any error — fail toward reaping). Consulting on **every** silent read (not only at the 90s mark) is required: the oracle needs a prior sample to compute a CPU/IO movement delta, so its first call after `reset()` always reads `UNKNOWN`/`"sampling"` — a single consult at the cutoff would always reap. `_liveness_oracle.reset()` runs at turn start so the movement baseline measures this turn only. Past the cutoff, **only `VERDICT_WORKING`** (moving CPU/IO in the backend subprocess subtree) defers the turn (loop continues); every other verdict (`DEAD`/`UNKNOWN`/`STUCK_INPUT`) preserves the prior end-the-turn behavior, so hang recovery is never weakened — a genuinely dead turn still ends, bounded by `_DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT` (2h) and the tool-stall watchdog below. Unlike the runtime path's `session/cancel` probe, the `AcpClient` reap is a plain `return` (process-per-session: the turn simply completes; no shared runtime to protect).

### Tool-stall watchdog

While a turn is dispatching, both ACP transports run a watchdog over a turn gone silent after a tool was dispatched — and both **recover** rather than just `return` on a dead turn (`AcpClient` keeps the blanket `_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT` window; the session handle is verdict-driven, below):

- **`AcpClient`** (process-per-session, `_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT = 600s`): the stall clock is measured against `_tool_last_seen = max(last_data_ts, self._last_activity)`, so tools that keepalive-ping without emitting stdout frames (`wait`, `spawn_sub_agents`) don't trip a false stall (`_last_activity` is refreshed out of band by the stderr drain / keepalive). On a real stall it `_kill_process(force=True)` and raises `AcpProcessDied`, routing through the existing pipe-death recovery (dashboard resets the session + re-queues, bounded by `_acp_pipe_death_retries`; cron/other callers get a clean error instead of a wedged slot). `_kill_process` only touches the subprocess/pipes (never `_turn_lock`), and blast radius is one session — each `AcpClient` owns exactly one process.
- **`runtime.py` / `AcpSessionHandle`**: watchdogs are **verdict-driven, not timeout-driven** — the prior design used timeouts as death detectors and killed healthy-but-slow work (a silent 30-min redirected build `long-build > build.log 2>&1` at exactly the blanket window; healthy long non-streamed reasoning at 90s, where the destructive `session/cancel` probe was acked by the LIVE turn and surfaced as "Turn cancelled by user"). Once a turn is idle past `watchdog.check_after_secs` (60s), the per-session `LivenessOracle` (`acp/liveness.py`) returns a verdict with evidence: **WORKING** (a live cmdline-matched shell child, a `wait` tool inside its declared duration + slack, moving CPU/IO counters, backend socket bytes flowing) is never acted on at any elapsed time (logged at most once per 10 min); **DEAD** (tracked shell child exited without a result frame past a 15s grace; model-wait with flat counters and NO established backend socket — the done-but-lost-frame wedge signature) acts immediately, so recovery lands seconds after actual death instead of at a blanket window; **STUCK_INPUT** (matched subtree flat across samples with a process blocked reading a tty/stdin pipe) acts immediately with a cause the recovery nudge names; **UNKNOWN** is the only timeout-governed class — stale probe at `watchdog.stale_window_secs` (300s; extended to `watchdog.model_silent_probe_secs` = 900s when the evidence is `established_flat`, i.e. probably a non-streamed server-side think), tool cancel at `watchdog.tool_stall_suspect_secs` (10800s / 3h — raised from 600s so long builds/MCP tools on macOS, where the liveness oracle degrades without `/proc`, are not falsely cancelled), hard-capped at `watchdog.tool_stall_hard_cap_secs` (10800s / 3h, UNKNOWN only). **Every watchdog action is non-lethal:** a stale probe's cancel-ack is reclassified in the turn-complete branch (`_stale_probe` + `stopReason==cancelled` → `STOP_REASON_STALE_RECOVER`; the flag is single-shot — consumed on reclassification and superseded by a genuine `cancel()`, so a user cancel arriving after a probe is never misattributed to auto-recovery) so the dashboard auto-recovers instead of logging a user cancellation — an oracle mistake costs a regeneration, never a session. A tool stall ends the turn with `STOP_REASON_TOOL_STALL` (`"error: tool stall"`, in the `error:` family so branch-less callers degrade to generic handling) carrying the tool title / redacted command / evidence on the terminal `AcpEvent`; chat_runner's dedicated branch queues a **continue-nudge** (`build_tool_stall_recovery_prompt` — check partial results, tail any `> file` redirect target, re-run non-interactively on STUCK_INPUT) instead of the legacy verbatim re-queue of the original user message (which restarted the whole task and re-ran the very command that stalled), charged against a separate `slot._tool_stall_retries` budget (3) so a stall never burns the pipe-death reconnect budget. The runtime is **shared** (multiple sessions multiplexed on one process), so recovery is always `session/cancel` for **this `sessionId` only** (bounded by `asyncio.wait_for(..., 5s)`); siblings keep running. `watchdog.*` config is snapshotted at handle construction (`WatchdogSettings`); the dispatch loop never reads config.

### Model-substitution advisory

kiro can return a `-32603` error that is an *advisory* that it substituted a different model, not a fatal failure. `_is_model_substitution_advisory()` (with `_extract_advisory_detail()` for the human-readable reason) recognizes this shape, and the session stays alive and continues the turn instead of tearing down — a real fatal error still propagates.

## Session Update Handling

`_extract_text_chunk()` handles two update types for text streaming:

- `agent_message_chunk` — standard text/content. Detects `type: "thinking"` or `"reasoning"` content blocks for extended thinking (kiro-cli style).
- `agent_thought_chunk` — dedicated reasoning update emitted by `claude-agent-acp`. Always treated as thinking content.

`_track_usage_update()` tracks context window usage from `usage_update` session events, reconciling the frame via the shared `parse_usage_update()` (flat `update.used`/`update.size` primary, nested `update.usage.*` fallback) so `AcpClient` and `AcpRuntime` read the same shape regardless of which kiro emits. A `KNOWN_SESSION_UPDATES` frozenset in `acp/types.py` suppresses false "unhandled session update" logs for plumbing-only update kinds (`plan`, `available_commands_update`, `current_mode_update`, `config_option_update`, `session_info_update`, `user_message_chunk`, `tool_call_update`). Only genuinely unknown kinds are logged.

**Context-window backfill.** kiro 2.10+ metadata may carry only a context-usage *percentage* (no absolute token counts). `_backfill_context_window(pct)` derives the window and used-token counts from the central `model_registry.model_window(self._resolved_model_id or self._model)` authority (gated on `has_known_window` so an unknown model is never backfilled with a guessed window) and the percentage, so the dashboard token text still renders when only a percentage arrives. `_resolved_model_id` is recorded from `models.currentModelId` (the model kiro actually served, which may differ from the requested one).

**Per-turn kiro billing credits.** `_track_metadata()` parses each `_kiro.dev/metadata` notification via the shared `parse_metadata()`, capturing `meteringUsage` entries with `unit=="credit"` (kiro bills in credits; token fields are 0 for the acp provider) into `AcpPromptStats.credits`, accumulated across the turn and surfaced on `EVENT_COMPLETE`.

## Exceptions

`AcpError` (base), `AcpTimeoutError` (has `partial_output`), `AcpPermissionNeeded`, `AcpProcessDied`, `AcpAuthRequired`, `AcpPromptBusy`.

- `AcpAuthRequired` — kiro-cli is not authenticated (`kiro-cli login` needed). Non-retryable: `ensure_ready()` skips the retry ladder and re-raises so callers surface the actionable message rather than reset-and-requeue.
- `AcpPromptBusy` — a prompt is already in progress on the session, classified from kiro-cli's "already in progress" text via `_PROMPT_BUSY_RE` and raised at prompt-dispatch sites. `slack/handler.py` catches it and auto-resets the wedged session (`sessions.reset`) before recording the failure, so the next message cold-starts cleanly.

## Process Management

Subprocess lifecycle:

- Spawned with process-tree isolation for clean teardown, dispatched per-platform in `_spawn()`: **POSIX** sets `start_new_session=True` (group leader via `setsid`) so cleanup can `killpg`; **Windows** sets `creationflags=platform_compat.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` (no `setsid`/process groups; an inherited Ctrl-C can't reach the gateway). Both flags are passed explicitly (never via `**dict` unpack, which breaks mypy's Popen overload resolution). Teardown in `_kill_process()` awaits `platform_compat.kill_process_tree_async(pid, SIGTERM)` then `SIGKILL` — `os.killpg(os.getpgid(pid), …)` on POSIX (inline, non-blocking), `taskkill /T /F` on Windows offloaded to `kiro_crew.executors.subprocess_executor` so the event loop is never blocked for the `taskkill.exe` spawn (Mesh-2801). The escaped-child sweep (`_kill_escaped_children`, which raw-`os.kill`s descendants that reparented out of the killed group) is **POSIX-only** — a no-op on Windows, where `taskkill /T` already walked the whole tree and `signal.SIGKILL`/`os.kill(pid,0)` are unavailable/unsafe. The `/proc`+`pgrep`+`ps` child-enumeration helpers (`_direct_children`, `_get_start_time`, `_read_basename`) short-circuit on Windows (return `[]`/`None`) since they only feed that POSIX sweep. `_resolve_ssh_auth_sock()` (called in the spawn prelude) is also a no-op on Windows — its non-darwin branch calls `os.getuid()`, absent on win32, and Windows OpenSSH uses a named pipe with no `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to repair.
- **Off-loop PID inspection**: the PID-recycling/ownership helpers that shell out on macOS — `_get_start_time` / `_read_basename` (`ps`), `_get_child_pids` → `_direct_children` (`pgrep`), the `_capture_child_records` batch wrapper, and the `_kill_escaped_children` sweep — MUST run via `run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), ...)`, never directly on the event loop. The subprocess spawn (fork/exec) can block, and on a wedged child the loop would freeze (the macOS wedge class). `subprocess_executor` is a *dedicated* bounded pool (distinct from the `maintenance_executor` orphan sweep) so a wedged scan/close cannot starve the recovery sweep. The `ps` and `pgrep` calls each carry a 2s timeout so no offloaded scan occupies a pool worker indefinitely.
- **Windows exe-casing normalization** (`_normalize_exe_casing`, applied to the kiro / claude-agent-acp / claude-code resolver results): `shutil.which` builds the resolved name's extension from `PATHEXT`, which lists `.EXE` upper-case, so it returns e.g. `…\kiro-cli.EXE` even though the on-disk file is `kiro-cli.exe`. A case-sensitive multiplexer shim spawned as `kiro-cli.EXE` fails to dispatch, exits instantly, and the ACP pipe breaks (`AcpProcessDied`) → the dashboard shows **"session stuck"** on the first chat turn. `os.path.realpath()` restores the true directory-entry casing. No-op on POSIX (case-sensitive FS). Runnability is checked via `platform_compat.is_executable_file()` (POSIX execute bit; on Windows the X-bit is meaningless so a known runnable extension is required instead), so a bare `.js` adapter entry is correctly treated as **not** directly runnable on Windows and gets wrapped with `node`.
- **OS-level sandbox**: `_spawn()` calls `sandbox.wrap_argv()` to wrap the kiro-cli command with platform-native isolation (Linux: two-stage `unshare -rm` → `unshare -U` bind-mounts + UID drop; macOS: `sandbox-exec` Seatbelt profile). Hides `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.docker`, `~/.kube` from the subprocess tree. Configurable via `sandbox_mode` constructor param (`"auto"` default, `"off"` to disable). See `docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`.
- **Parent-level channel-credential scrub**: both spawn paths (`AcpClient._spawn` and `AcpRuntime._spawn`) build the child environment from a raw `os.environ` copy (plus `_extra_env`) and pass it directly to `create_subprocess_exec`, so they call `sandbox.scrub_agent_denied_env(env)` after merging `_extra_env` to strip `_AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS` (Slack/WeCom/Telegram tokens + owner id seeded into `os.environ` by `config.loader.load_credentials`). This is required because these paths do NOT route through `sandboxed_spawn_argv`, and the OS-sandbox launcher only strips those keys for the `cc`/`strict` tiers — on the default `auto`/`standard` tier the launcher leaves them in place, so without the parent scrub they would be inherited by the agent subprocess. The scrub is deliberately narrower than `scrub_env`: it leaves the AWS/SSH env the `standard` sandbox intentionally exposes (git-over-SSH, AWS CLI, kubectl) untouched.
- `_resolve_kiro_bin()` delegates to the side-effect-free `kiro_cli.resolve_kiro_cli()` discovery module shared with first-run setup. It checks the explicit `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` operator/test override first, then the supported fixed install locations and augmented PATH; setup status may inspect the same candidates but never mutates the override or other process-global environment. The gateway's prerequisite service and the direct `chat`/`tui`/`run`/`consolidate`/`eval` CLI entry paths both register the override's canonical path and first-observed digest before any provider can be created; process-lifetime first-observation-wins semantics prevent a later service reconstruction from blessing replacement bytes. `runtime.py` imports and reuses the ACP wrapper so both ACP transports select the binary identically. Immediately before OS sandboxing, `sandbox.py` routes argv[0] through the edition-neutral `PlatformContext.agent_executable` resolver; the public Default is identity and a companion can return a direct executable behind an edition-managed launcher without changing the core.
- The dashboard `/api/models` one-shot subprocess validates completion before parsing stdout: nonzero exit (with a bounded, redacted stderr tail), empty stdout, malformed JSON, or a payload without a model list each returns HTTP 503 so the client retries. A subprocess failure is never misreported as `JSONDecodeError` or cached as a successful empty model list.
- **Poll-driven spawn sites are readiness-gated.** `kiro-cli` auto-launches an
  interactive browser login for any subcommand run unauthenticated
  (`--no-interactive` does not suppress it; there is no opt-out env var). Every
  dashboard endpoint that shells out to `kiro-cli` on a timer therefore calls
  `reject_if_kiro_unverified()` BEFORE resolving or spawning the binary:
  `/api/models` (polled every 8s while the model list is degraded) and
  `/api/sessions/usage` (polled every 30s by the credit pill). Both return the
  shared `kiro_prerequisite_required` 503 — the same degraded response their
  timeout branches already produce — so the client contract is unchanged and
  only the subprocess is skipped. Without this gate a signed-out gateway opened
  a browser window every 8 seconds indefinitely. These are the **only** blocking
  readiness gates: ordinary sends are ungated, because a failing ACP attempt
  reports its own `AcpAuthRequired` (see the governance of latched readiness in
  `modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md`), whereas a timer-driven spawn has no turn to
  carry that error. These sites authorize on a **freshly verified** probe
  (`verified_ready`, 30s ceiling), never the bare latch — a stale `ready=True`
  would green-light exactly the signed-out spawn the gate exists to prevent.
- **`AcpAuthRequired` is the authoritative logout signal.** Readiness is probed
  at gateway start and on explicit user action only, so a mid-session sign-out is
  discovered when the ACP attempt fails, not by a poll. `AcpRuntime`/`AcpClient`
  translate the stderr `not logged in` banner into the non-retryable
  `AcpAuthRequired`; the dashboard turn loop handles it ahead of the generic
  `AcpError` branch (it is a subclass), never re-queues it, surfaces the
  actionable `kiro-cli login` message in the transcript, and latches the
  prerequisite service to signed-out. That error card is the **only** sign-out
  signal the dashboard shows — there is no reauthentication banner and no paused
  session state (see `modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md` § "The dashboard does not
  guide the user to sign in").
- **The readiness `whoami` runs against the real home, like an ACP session.**
  `kiro_prerequisite._run_auth_command(..., isolate_home=False)` runs the
  resolved CLI against the real environment/home under the standard OS sandbox
  with only the KiroCrew data home hidden, and executes a sandbox-visible
  private snapshot of the resolved bytes (keeping the resolved basename so a
  multiplexer still dispatches). A rewritten `HOME` breaks any CLI whose session
  or tool registry lives in the real home — a toolbox multiplexer cannot even
  resolve itself — so the isolated probe reported such CLIs signed-out even
  though a real session authenticates fine.
- **Sign-in is fully delegated to `kiro-cli`.** `kiro-cli login
  --use-device-flow` runs against the user's REAL home and writes its own
  credential store, exactly as it does from a terminal. KiroCrew stages no
  credentials and copies none back — the staged-home publish path (and the
  "Kiro identity changed during sign-in" conflict two racing gateways could
  hit) is gone. The isolated credential-minimal home remains available for
  callers that opt into it, so a probe can never read the real `~/.aws` /
  `~/.ssh`; the operator-initiated login runs in the real home inside the same
  OS sandbox posture ACP already uses, with the KiroCrew data home hidden.
- 10MB stdout buffer for large JSON-RPC lines
- stderr drained in background (`_drain_stderr`) to prevent pipe deadlock. Each line bumps `_last_activity` (liveness for `is_responsive`), is appended to the bounded 20-entry `_stderr_lines` diagnostic ring buffer, and is forwarded as a redacted `WARNING`. **Exception — suppression filter:** lines matching a marker in the module-level `_SUPPRESSED_STDERR_MARKERS` tuple (currently `thinking_tokens`) are dropped — no `WARNING`, not appended to the ring buffer — but **still** bump `_last_activity`. This handles the claude-agent-acp "Unexpected case: {...thinking_tokens...}" stderr noise. **Mechanism** (confirmed by reading the vendored adapter's `dist/acp-agent.js`): claude-code emits a `system` message with subtype `thinking_tokens`, but the adapter's `switch (message.subtype)` enumerates only ~18 known subtypes (`init`, `status`, `compact_boundary`, `memory_recall`, `api_retry`, …) and routes anything else to `default: unreachable(message)`, which writes `logger.error("Unexpected case: " + JSON.stringify(message))` to stderr — one line per token delta, measured at ~10 lines/sec during active thinking (one per 2–4 thinking tokens). The payload is only `estimated_tokens`/`_delta`/`uuid`/`session_id`, so dropping it loses no response content. This is a forward-compat gap in the vendored adapter, **not** new behavior in a specific claude-code build — the `thinking_tokens` event is present in both `2.1.165.357` and `2.1.168.358` (verified by string-matching both bundled `claude` binaries), so it predates the `.168` update that drew attention to it. The cleaner long-term fix is upstream (add a `thinking_tokens` case to the adapter or bump the vendored version); this filter is the version-agnostic stopgap that also absorbs the next unenumerated subtype's flood. (Note `thinking_tokens` is by far the dominant subtype hitting `unreachable` — ~14k occurrences vs. a handful of rare `permission_denied` across retained logs — which is why the marker tuple stays narrow rather than suppressing all "Unexpected case" lines.) Two concrete reasons to drop rather than downgrade the level: (1) **log hygiene** — `gateway.log` uses `RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2MB, backupCount=3)` (`cli.py`), so a sustained burst rolls genuine diagnostics out of the retained 8MB window; (2) **event-loop load** — the file handler is a plain *synchronous* handler and `_drain_stderr` runs on the gateway event loop, so each forwarded line costs a synchronous file write + two regex redaction passes on the same loop that streams responses (small per session, compounding across concurrent thinking sessions). Keeping liveness prevents the idle watchdog from killing an actively-thinking turn; skipping the ring buffer stops a burst from evicting the last real errors. A throttled `DEBUG` summary (≥ `_SUPPRESSED_STDERR_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS` apart, plus a flush at EOF) keeps the suppression observable. Match substrings are kept narrow so a genuine error is never silently swallowed. This is a log-volume / event-loop-load reduction — **not** a fix for any turn-stall or "agent not responding" symptom (no such causal link was established).

### Startup telemetry

`ensure_ready()` emits the `kirocrew.session.startup.duration` histogram (unit `ms`) timing the cold-start work — subprocess spawn + session init. The warm fast-path (an already-spawned, already-initialized session returns early) is intentionally **not** measured, since it does no startup work. The emit lives in a `finally` covering **every** exit path, with `outcome` recorded as one of `ready` / `auth_required` / `error` (defaulting to `error`, so any unexpected exception propagating through the `finally` is counted as a failure, never a false `ready`) and `spawned` (bool — whether this call actually forked a new process). `get_recorder` is **lazily imported** inside the `finally` to break the `config.loader → acp.types → acp.client → metrics.provider → config.loader` import cycle, and the entire emit is wrapped in `try/except` so a telemetry failure can never break session startup.

### Worker-pool tool audit (`audit_source`)

The `audit_source` constructor param (default `None`) tags an `AcpClient` that runs tools **outside** the chat_runner / SubagentManager audit loop — the knowledge `llm_pool` worker-pool client, whose tool calls would otherwise never reach the security audit log. When set, `_maybe_audit_tool_call()` emits a per-tool-call SEL `tool_invocation` record; when `None` (chat / subagent clients) it is a no-op so those paths never double-log. The `sel().log_tool_invocation` call is offloaded onto `subprocess_executor()` (so SEL-backend I/O can never block the event loop) and bounded by `asyncio.wait_for(..., _SEL_AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5.0)`; a timeout or any SEL failure is swallowed (logged at `WARNING`) so tool dispatch always proceeds. **Note:** Code Review Sage's `ReviewPool` used to be an `audit_source` `AcpClient` consumer here, but it migrated to the shared `AcpRuntime` path (see "Additional consumers" above) — the runtime layer has no `audit_source`, so the pool re-emits the same per-tool SEL `tool_invocation` audit itself from `sage_lib/review_pool.py` (preserving audit parity).

## Image Support

`_send_prompt()` auto-detects image file paths in messages (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`) via regex. When a valid image path is found:

1. Reads the file (paths over `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` = 10 MB stay as text, not inlined)
2. Downscales so the longest edge is <= `MAX_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (2000 px), preserving aspect ratio and re-encoding to the same format (an oversized GIF becomes a PNG still frame)
3. Shrinks further while the base64 payload still exceeds `MAX_IMAGE_B64_BYTES` (5 MiB), stopping at `MIN_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (256 px)
4. Base64-encodes the (possibly downscaled) bytes
5. Appends an image content block: `{"type": "image", "data": "<base64>", "mimeType": "image/png"}`
6. Replaces the path in the text with `[image: filename.png]`
7. Sends both text and image blocks in the `prompt` array

This leverages kiro-cli's `promptCapabilities.image: true` capability. The LLM receives the image inline — no tool call needed.

**Dimension backstop** (`build_prompt_blocks` in `acp/prompt_blocks.py`). This shared builder is the single funnel every channel's images cross before reaching kiro-cli, so the `MAX_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (2000 px) downscale runs for all of them — dashboard upload/paste/screenshot, Slack, Discord. Anthropic rejects the ENTIRE request when a many-image conversation (>20 images) carries any image over 2000 px on a side; because kiro-cli replays the full message history every turn, one oversized image would otherwise sit at a fixed history index and wedge the session permanently (a follow-up resize cannot evict the original). The browser's client-side resize (1568 px, `website/src/utils/resizeImage.ts`) is a token-cost optimization on top; this server-side cap is the correctness guarantee that still holds when that resize is skipped or bypassed (e.g. the native `/api/screenshot` capture, or non-dashboard channels).

**Encoded-size backstop** (`_fit_encoded_budget`, same module). The dimension cap alone does not bound the payload: a raster can sit well inside 2000 px and still encode past the backend's per-image byte ceiling. `MAX_IMAGE_B64_BYTES` is **5 MiB, read out of the backend's own rejection** rather than derived from which provider kiro-cli routes through (which we treat as opaque) — the error names the limit in bytes, `image exceeds 5 MB maximum: 6714372 bytes > 5242880`, and 5242880 is exactly 5 × 1024 × 1024. Anthropic's published per-image ceiling for Bedrock and Google Cloud agrees, which is corroboration rather than the basis. The check must run on the ENCODED payload AFTER any downscale: `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` measures the file before the re-encode and cannot see base64's 4/3 inflation, so a ~3.9 MiB raster passes every pre-encode gate and is still rejected on the wire. Because a rejected image is replayed from a fixed history index on every later turn, this has the same wedge-the-session consequence as the dimension case. Erring low merely ships a smaller image while erring high ships a refused payload, so the cap is set to the observed value and callers can override it via `max_image_b64_bytes` if a backend ever reports a different number. `_fit_encoded_budget` applies the dimension cap, then keeps shrinking (0.8 per pass, up to 6 passes, from the rendition's OWN long edge so an already-in-cap image still makes progress) until the encoding fits. If nothing fits above `MIN_IMAGE_EDGE_PX` (256 px) it fails CLOSED — the path stays in the text and no image block is emitted, because inlining a payload the backend refuses is strictly worse than sending a reference a tool-capable agent can open.


## AcpRuntime & AcpSessionHandle (session multiplexing)

Alongside `AcpClient` (one `kiro-cli` process per session, guarded by
`_turn_lock`), the ACP package provides **`AcpRuntime`** — a single `kiro-cli`
process that multiplexes **N concurrent sessions** via a single stdout reader
that demuxes frames by `params.sessionId` into per-session queues (no
`_turn_lock`). Each session is fronted by an **`AcpSessionHandle`**; an
**`AcpSessionProvider`** adapts a handle to the `LLMProvider` interface so it is
a drop-in replacement for `AcpClient`.

Both transports share one parser — `acp/_dispatch.py`
(`parse_session_update`, `build_permission_event`, `parse_usage_update`, …) — so
they cannot drift. `AcpRuntime.load_session()` mirrors `AcpClient`'s resume
handshake: it issues `session/load` directly under the original sessionId and
registers the session queue **after** the load response so replayed transcript
frames are dropped rather than counted against the current turn.

**Unroutable frames are counted, not logged per frame.** The reader drops any
frame it cannot route; the drop itself is correct and unchanged, but logging one
`DEBUG` line per dropped frame is a log-retention hazard on a multiplexed
backend. Every frame for a torn-down or not-yet-registered sessionId takes that
branch — including the entire transcript replay of a `session/load` (the queue is
registered after the response, above) — and a backend that keeps streaming after
teardown makes it an unbounded **steady state**, not a burst. Measured on an
operator host: ~60 lines/second sustained for 6+ hours from one gateway PID,
33–59% of every `gateway.log` rotation, which at
`RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2MB, backupCount=3)` (`cli.py`) rolled the
diagnostics an incident needed out of the retained 8MB window before they could
be read. So `_reader_loop` funnels the two **frame-rate** drop paths — a frame
whose `sessionId` is not registered, and a no-`sessionId` global notification
arriving while zero sessions are registered (sentinel `_DROP_NO_SESSION`) —
through `_note_dropped_frame()`, which tallies `(sessionId, method)` and emits
one `DEBUG` summary carrying the accumulated count at most every
`_DROP_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS` (60s). The key stays **per session** deliberately:
the decisive signal in the incident was that two *different* session UUIDs were
flooding at once, which a single global tally would hide. The level stays `DEBUG`
— the goal is far fewer lines, not louder ones.

Three properties make the counter safe on the demux hot path: it never awaits
(no timer task to leak — the flush rides the next drop), the map is bounded
(`_DROP_SUMMARY_MAX_KEYS` = 64 distinct keys forces an early flush instead of
growth, and both backend-controlled key halves are truncated to
`_DROP_SUMMARY_KEY_MAX_CHARS` = 80), and the residual count is flushed in the
loop's `finally` on **every** exit (EOF, exhausted oversize-drain budget, cancel,
crash) so a low-rate trickle is reported late rather than swallowed. No lock is
needed: `_reader_loop` is the sole writer (`spawn()` creates exactly one reader
task). The two response-shaped drop branches (non-numeric id, unmatched id) stay
per-frame on purpose — the id is their whole diagnostic value and is distinct per
frame, so aggregating by it would give the counter an unbounded key space while
aggregating without it would discard the only identifying datum; both are also
bounded by the requests this runtime issued, so neither has the after-teardown
steady state.

**An oversize stdout line is a dropped frame, not a dead runtime.** A single
JSON-RPC line over the reader's `_STDOUT_BUFFER_LIMIT` (10 MB) used to
`_mark_dead` the runtime, which fails every pending future and poisons every
session queue — so one huge frame ended *every* session multiplexed on that
process mid-turn, surfacing to users as "process exited / chat failure". Both ACP
readers did this on the strength of a claim that asyncio leaves the stream
corrupted after an overrun and every subsequent read also fails. That claim is
false: `StreamReader.readline` repairs the buffer *before* raising `ValueError`
(deleting the oversize line through its terminating newline when one is buffered,
else clearing the buffer) and resumes the transport, as its own docstring states.

So `_reader_loop` reads through `readuntil(b"\n")` and, on `LimitOverrunError`,
hands the line to `_drain_oversize_line()`, which consumes it **entirely, through
its terminating newline**, and discards it — the same consume-prefix-and-retry
drain as `mcp_gateway/backend.py::run_stdout_pump`, where a plain `read(n)` would
eat into the *next* frame. Draining the whole line rather than one prefix at a
time is load-bearing, not tidiness: the unterminated branch's discard boundary is
an arbitrary byte offset (`consumed = len(buffer)`), so surfacing the remainder as
a line hands the parser a byte-slice that can start mid-character. `json.loads`
then raises `UnicodeDecodeError`, which is **not** a `json.JSONDecodeError` — it
escapes the loop's non-JSON guard into its crash handler and kills every
multiplexed session, the very outcome this replaces. Any oversize frame carrying
CJK or emoji reaches it whenever the final remainder falls under the reader limit.

Because this reader is a standalone task with no deadline, an endlessly
unterminated stream still needs a terminal state, so the drain carries a budget of
`_OVERSIZE_DRAIN_MAX_BYTES` (160 MB) and raises `OversizeLineUnrecoverable` past
it, which the loop turns into `_mark_dead`. The budget counts **bytes** and is
scoped to a single drain call — deliberately *not* a count of oversize *frames*,
and needing no cross-iteration state because every call that returns ends on a
frame boundary. A replay of properly terminated but oversize frames therefore
stays survivable frame after frame; a frame counter would reproduce the very
defect this replaces. The liveness oracle cannot substitute for the budget: it
judges by CPU/IO movement, and a garbage-spewing stream moves both, so it would
report `WORKING`.

A pending request whose response was in a dropped frame is not orphaned —
`_send_and_await` wraps every future in `wait_for(timeout=…)`, so the caller gets
a timeout; the warning names the request ids in flight at the drop so that timeout
is attributable. `AcpClient._read_message` takes the same drop-and-continue stance
by returning `None` (joining its blank-line and non-JSON paths) but keeps
`readline` and carries **no** budget: every call there is bounded by the caller's
`timeout` and the callers run their own deadlines, so the worst case is one turn
ending on its deadline rather than unbounded state.

Every kiro session runs on `AcpRuntime` + `AcpSessionHandle`:
`AcpProvider.start()` (`providers/acp.py`) unconditionally calls
`_start_kiro_runtime()` for the kiro backend, wrapping an `AcpSessionHandle` in
`AcpSessionProvider` — so main chat, dashboard, cron, and subagents all run on
the runtime rather than a per-session `AcpClient`. Additional consumers:
`AcpRuntime` also powers the `_bg` pool, (when `agent.session_sharing` is on)
the shared parent+subagents runtime, and **Code Review Sage's `ReviewPool`**
(`apps/builtins/code_review_sage/sage_lib/review_pool.py`) — one batch-scoped
`AcpRuntime` multiplexing one `AcpSessionHandle` per PR under a concurrency
semaphore (`review.max_concurrent`, default 5, ceiling 30), spawned on batch
start and `kill()`ed when the batch drains, with each per-PR session
`destroy()`ed on completion for context isolation. Because the runtime layer has
no `audit_source`, the pool re-emits the equivalent per-tool SEL audit itself
(see the `audit_source` note above). See `providers.md` and `subagent.md`.
