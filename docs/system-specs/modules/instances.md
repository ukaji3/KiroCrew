# Instances Module (multi-instance management over SSH tunnels)

Lets a single Kiro Crew gateway (the **hub**) manage and switch between several
**remote** Kiro Crew instances (dev hosts, EC2, home servers) over SSH **or AWS
SSM Session Manager** tunnels, embedding each remote dashboard as an iframe pane
below a switcher strip. Opt-in: off by default (`instances.enabled`). The transport is
per-instance (`connection_method`) — see §13.

Code: `src/kiro_crew/instances/` (registry, tunnel manager, port allocator, token

## 1. Overview

A Kiro Crew gateway normally binds the dashboard to loopback only. The Instances
feature lets the hub reach *other* gateways running on remote hosts by opening an
SSH `-L` forward to each remote's loopback dashboard port, minting a short-lived
dashboard token on the remote, and embedding the remote dashboard in an
`<iframe>`. You switch panes from a dropdown (`InstanceTabBar`, plus
Cmd/Ctrl+digit in the Electron shell); the hub keeps the most-recently-used set
"warm" (tunnel + iframe live) and lazily reconnects the rest. The switcher is a
menu rather than a row of chips by DEFAULT because the number of configured crews
is unbounded: the closed trigger costs constant width, and unread counts stay
visible on it as an aggregate badge over every crew that is not on screen. A user
who switches between the same two or three crews can PIN those out of the menu
into always-visible chips beside it, spending header width only on the
destinations they actually use — see [Pinned crew chips](#pinned-crew-chips).

**Key properties**

- **Opt-in.** Nothing changes until `instances.enabled=true`, and the flag is
  read at gateway startup, so it also needs a restart.
- **Owner-only.** The control plane is never reachable via Slack and requires an
  authenticated dashboard session.
- **Loopback-only.** Tunnels forward `127.0.0.1:<local>` to remote
  `127.0.0.1:<remote>`.
- **Warm, not persistent.** Tokens are short-lived (20h cap) and re-minted
  before they lapse; iframes are evicted past the warm cap.

## 2. Enabling the feature

```bash
kirocrew config set instances.enabled true
kirocrew restart
```

Settings → Instances offers the same toggle (it PATCHes
`instances.enabled` through `/api/config/kirocrew`) and then shows a
"restart required" hint, because the flag is only consulted in the gateway's
`on_startup` hook.

When enabled at startup, the gateway:

1. creates the instances registry + `SshTunnelManager` and auto-reconnects every
   instance whose `was_connected` hint is set, and
2. extends the dashboard CSP `frame-src` with `http://*.localhost:*` so an
   embedded remote dashboard on a `*.localhost` host can render.

Loopback origins (`http://127.0.0.1:*`, `http://localhost:*`, plus the https and
`0.0.0.0` forms) are in `frame-src` **unconditionally** because the Web Preview
panel needs them; only the `*.localhost` wildcard is instances-gated.

With the flag off, `/api/instances/*` returns `403` and the panel shows an
opt-in card. `GET /api/instances` also reports `active`, which is true only when
the SSH manager actually exists: `enabled && !active` means the flag was set
after startup and a restart is still pending.

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Module responsibilities:

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `registry.py` | Persistent list of configured instances (`~/.kiro/crew/instances.json`) + `last_active_id`. Light charset check on `ssh_host`/`remote_bin` (SSH) or `ssm_target`/`aws_profile`/`aws_region`/`ssm_run_as` (SSM) at add/update, per `connection_method`; every mutation re-reads the file and writes atomically, so a live gateway and a CLI edit cannot clobber each other. |
| `port_allocator.py` | Probes for a free loopback port at or above `tunnel_base_port` (7778). The probe sets `SO_REUSEADDR` so a `TIME_WAIT` remnant from a just-closed forward is not a false "in use". |
| `token_mint.py` | Runs `kirocrew token --ttl --port --embed-parent-port` on the remote over SSH (run-marker first, then a bin-candidate ladder) and parses the JWT out of the printed URL. Token is returned in memory only, **never logged**. |
| `ssm_token_mint.py` | The SSM sibling of `token_mint.py`: runs the same subcommand via `aws ssm send-command` through the launcher's `cloud.ssm` chokepoint, reusing the shared remote-command builders. Token in memory only, **never logged**. See §13. |
| `validation.py` | The authoritative injection-safe guard on `ssh_host` / `remote_bin`, and on `ssm_target` / `aws_profile` / `aws_region` / `ssm_run_as`, applied immediately before any command line is built. See §11. |
| `run_marker.py` | Records the running gateway's own `kirocrew` launcher (and pid) keyed by port, so a remote mint execs the same venv the live gateway runs from. Also backs zero-config client port discovery. See §12. |
| `ssh_tunnel_manager.py` | Supervises one tunnel child per instance — `ssh -N -L` or `aws ssm start-session` — with readiness wait, health probe, 2-tier self-heal, proactive token refresh, stored-token liveness probe, remote restart, orphan-forwarder reaping. One state machine, two transports. |
| `diagnostics.py` | Dependency-ordered failure probes; reports the first broken link. `diagnose_instance` (SSH ladder) and `diagnose_instance_ssm` (SSM ladder). |
| `handlers_instances.py` | Owner-only, enabled-gated, SEL-audited HTTP control plane. |

**The local forward port mirrors the remote port.** `connect()` sets
`local_port = inst.remote_port` rather than allocating a fresh one: the embedded
iframe loads from `http://<host>:<local_port>`, and the remote gateway only
trusts CSRF/WebSocket `Origin`s on its own configured port, so mirroring keeps
the Origin valid with no per-instance allowlisting. The consequence is a hard
constraint: **every simultaneously-connected instance must use a distinct remote
port**, and a busy port is a clear connect error rather than a silent fallback
(a different local port would leave the pane unable to stream or act). The
`PortAllocator` is therefore constructed but not on the connect path today; the
`tunnel_base_port` setting configures it.

**Platform note.** The hub side of this feature assumes a POSIX host with an
OpenSSH `ssh` client on `PATH`. Two paths make that explicit: the
orphan-forwarder reaper shells `ps -axww -o pid=,command=` and signals with a
direct `os.kill(pid, signal.SIGTERM)` rather than going through
`platform_compat`, and run-marker port discovery refuses outright on non-POSIX
(§12). Treat a Windows hub as unverified.

---

## 4. The connect → warm → self-heal lifecycle

1. **Connect.** `POST /api/instances/{id}/connect` validates the ssh inputs,
   reaps any orphaned forwarder still holding the mirrored port, starts
   `ssh -N -L`, waits until the local forward accepts a TCP connection, mints a
   dashboard token on the remote over SSH, and returns the live status plus the
   token. Connect is **idempotent**: an already-connected instance returns its
   current status, and the handler then *probes* the stored token before handing
   it over (see below). The browser loads
   `http://<dashboard-hostname>:<local>/?token=...` in an iframe, deliberately
   reusing the parent's own hostname so the pane is same-site with the parent and
   `SameSite=Lax` auth cookies are not withheld.
2. **Warm set.** Up to `warm_set_cap` (default 5) most-recently-used instances
   stay warm: iframe mounted (hide-not-unmount, so switching never reloads or
   re-runs the token handshake) with a live tunnel and WebSocket. Exceeding the
   cap **evicts the least-recently-used non-active iframe**. Eviction unmounts
   the iframe only: it does NOT disconnect the tunnel or clear `was_connected`,
   so the switcher entry persists and re-warms on the next click. Entries
   disappear only on an explicit disconnect.
3. **Health probe.** While CONNECTED, a per-tunnel loop polls the loopback
   forward every `DEFAULT_PROBE_INTERVAL_SECS` (30s, not user-configurable;
   `<= 0` disables the probe); after `probe_failure_threshold` (3) *consecutive*
   failures the child is terminated so recovery fires. This is what catches a
   tunnel that is alive but no longer forwarding.
4. **2-tier self-heal.** On unexpected child exit: **Tier 1** rebuilds the tunnel
   reusing the existing token; **Tier 2** re-mints the token over SSH and then
   rebuilds. Capped at `max_recovery_attempts` (8) consecutive attempts with a
   capped-exponential backoff (`recover_backoff_max_secs`, 30s; the wait grows
   1, 2, 4, 8, 16 then holds at the cap), which spans roughly a two-minute
   window: long enough to outlast a transient drop (screen lock, proxy warmup).
   The counter resets on a successful rebuild or a successful `connect()`. If it
   gives up, the diagnosis ladder runs automatically. The slow SSH I/O runs
   *without* the manager lock so self-heal cannot stall a concurrent
   connect/disconnect/shutdown.
5. **Proactive token refresh.** A per-instance loop re-mints the token at
   `DEFAULT_TOKEN_REFRESH_FRACTION` (0.8) of its TTL, ahead of the 20h cap. The
   frontend mirrors the same 0.8 threshold from `token_ttl_remaining` and skips
   the *active* pane, so a reload never interrupts the pane in use.
6. **Stored-token liveness probe.** A token can go stale while the tunnel stays
   CONNECTED (a failed self-heal re-mint, or a remote `kirocrew restart` that
   invalidates tokens). An iframe loaded with a stale token gets a
   server-rendered 403, so the SPA never boots to fire the reactive
   `mc-auth-expired` recovery. `connect` therefore probes
   `GET /api/status?token=...` over the *existing* forward (no SSH,
   `DEFAULT_TOKEN_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS` = 2s) and is deny-by-default: anything
   short of a 2xx forces a fresh mint, and if that mint also fails the response
   is a clean 502 rather than a token the gateway cannot stand behind.
7. **Diagnose / restart.** `?diagnose=1` runs the probe ladder on demand;
   `POST .../restart` runs `kirocrew restart` on the **remote** over SSH
   (itself service-aware), after which the local probe detects the bounce and
   self-heals.

**Startup revive.** When the feature is on, the startup hook reconnects every
instance with `was_connected` set, serially (so they do not race to bind their
mirrored ports) and each wrapped, so one unreachable host neither aborts the rest
nor crashes startup. It runs as a background task rather than awaited, because
`on_startup` fires *before* the HTTP port is bound and serial SSH connects would
delay the bind past the desktop app's gateway-wait window. A failed revive leaves
`was_connected` true and records the failure reason, so the entry persists showing
why it is down.

## 5. Configuration

### 5.1 `instances.*` config keys

Transport defaults and bounds live in `kiro_crew.instances.constants` and are
referenced from `InstancesConfig`, so the documented values and runtime policy
cannot drift.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `instances.enabled` | `false` | Primary opt-in, read at gateway startup. Also gates the CSP `frame-src` `*.localhost` extension. |
| `instances.warm_set_cap` | `5` | Max instances kept warm at once (bounds memory/sockets; each warm instance is a full dashboard SPA). Clamped up to 1. |
| `instances.tunnel_base_port` | `7778` | First local loopback port the allocator hands out. Out-of-range values fall back to the default. |
| `instances.ssh_compression` | `true` | Add `-C` to the tunnel argv. See §5.2. |
| `instances.connect_timeout_secs` | unset (SSH `15.0`, SSM `25.0`) | How long (secs) to wait for the local forward port to accept connections before declaring a connect attempt failed. Hosts behind a ProxyCommand or jump host need longer (the proxy handshake runs before ssh begins the forward). An explicit value applies to both transports, including a value equal to either transport's default. Values below 1 fall back to the transport defaults; values above 120 are clamped to 120. |
| `instances.mint_timeout_secs` | unset (SSH `30.0`, SSM `90.0`) | How long (secs) to wait for the remote `kirocrew token` mint before failing a connect. The mint rides the same ssh transport as the tunnel, so a host behind a ProxyCommand or jump host pays the proxy handshake here too (the connect flow spawns two proxy-bound ssh children: `connect_timeout_secs` budgets the first, this budgets the second). An explicit value applies to both transports, including a value equal to either transport's default — size it for the slowest transport in use. Values below 10 fall back to the transport defaults; values above 120 are clamped with a warning. |
| `instances.max_recovery_attempts` | `8` | Consecutive self-heal attempts before the tunnel is left disconnected. Below 1 falls back to the default; above `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS_CEILING` (100) is clamped with a warning, so a pathological setting cannot turn bounded self-heal into a near-infinite retry loop. |
| `instances.recover_backoff_max_secs` | `30.0` | Cap on the per-attempt backoff. Non-positive falls back to the default; above `RECOVER_BACKOFF_MAX_CEILING_SECS` (300) is clamped, bounding the worst-case wall-clock recovery window. |
| `instances.probe_failure_threshold` | `3` | Consecutive health-probe failures before a non-forwarding tunnel is torn down. Below 1 falls back to the default. |

```bash
kirocrew config set instances.warm_set_cap 3
kirocrew config set instances.ssh_compression false
kirocrew config set instances.connect_timeout_secs 45
kirocrew config set instances.mint_timeout_secs 60
```

Constants that are **not** user-configurable: the probe interval (30s), the token
refresh fraction (0.8), and the stored-token probe timeout (2s).

### 5.2 `instances.ssh_compression`

Adds `-C` (zlib transport compression) to the supervised `ssh -N -L` argv. It is
on by default, and the reasoning is specific to what travels over this one
forwarded stream: the *entire* remote dashboard, meaning the SPA bundle on first
connect plus every subsequent API and WebSocket frame. That payload is
JS/HTML/JSON, which compresses well, and the gateway does **not** gzip its HTTP
responses, so `-C` is the only compression anywhere in the path and nothing is
double-compressed. The dominant deployment is a dedicated remote gateway host
reached over a higher-latency link, where spending remote CPU to save bandwidth
is the right trade. On a fast or local link the CPU cost can outweigh the
bandwidth win, which is why it stays tunable.

The flag is read once, at startup, into the `SshTunnelManager`, and each
`_SshTunnel` inherits it; changing it takes effect on the next gateway restart.
Only the *tunnel* argv is affected. The token-mint and diagnostics `ssh`
invocations do not compress (they are single short commands, so there is nothing
to gain).

### 5.3 Registry file

`~/.kiro/crew/instances.json`, one record per instance:

```
id, name, ssh_host, remote_port (default 7777), local_port (0 = unallocated),
ttl (default "20h"), remote_bin, was_connected
```

plus a top-level `last_active_id`. `id` is a slug (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`)
derived from `name` when not given, with a numeric suffix on collision. The file
holds **connection coordinates only**: no credentials or tokens are ever written
there. Every anchored validator in this package ends with `\Z`, never `$`: Python's `$` also matches just before a trailing newline, so a `"20h\n"` would pass a `$`-anchored check and then reach an ssh/ssm argument list carrying an embedded newline. `ttl` is validated against the SAME bound the token minters enforce
(`^[1-9][0-9]{0,3}[hm]$`): a value this layer accepted but they rejected would
persist and then fail at the next connect, blaming the tunnel for a bad edit.

Two persisted hints drive lazy reconnect:

- `was_connected` is sticky "connection intent". It is set when a tunnel opens
  and cleared **only** on an explicit user disconnect, deliberately surviving
  gateway shutdown and a failed auto-revive, so the frontend keeps the entry in an
  error / click-to-reconnect state instead of dropping it. It is also what the
  frontend keys entry visibility on (`was_connected || connected || warm`).
- `last_active_id` records the instance most recently connected to. `connect()`
  writes it and `remove()` clears it, and any value that no longer resolves to a
  live record is dropped on the next write. Nothing in the gateway reads it:
  startup revive keys on `was_connected` and revives *every* intended instance,
  not just one, and the active pane is frontend state. `get_last_active()` is the
  only reader and has no production caller.

`disconnect()` resets `local_port` to the unallocated sentinel together with
`was_connected` in one write, so a freed port is never left reserved.

---

## 6. API (owner-only control plane)

All routes are gated by `_guard()`: **deny-by-default**. It rejects a
Slack-origin request (an `X-Session-Key` starting `slack:`) with `403`, rejects a
request with no `request["user"]` with `401`, and rejects a disabled feature with
`403`. Every call, success and denial alike, emits a SEL audit event
(`instances_<operation>`).

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/instances` | List instances + live status + `warm_set_cap` + `active`. |
| `POST /api/instances` | Add an instance. |
| `PATCH /api/instances/{id}` | Edit `name`/`ssh_host`/`remote_port`/`ttl`/`remote_bin`/`connection_method`/`ssm_target`/`ssm_run_as`/`aws_profile`/`aws_region` (`id` and internal hints are not editable). Editing a field the tunnel is BUILT from (everything except `name` and `ttl`) disconnects a live tunnel first, because it would otherwise keep forwarding the old port to the old host under the new label; the teardown passes `keep_intent=True` so it does not touch `was_connected` — that flag records a USER disconnect, so a reconfiguration leaves it alone and a real disconnect arriving mid-edit still wins. The crew therefore keeps its switcher entry and reconnects in one click. The teardown and the coordinate rewrite happen as ONE operation, `SshTunnelManager.reconfigure()`, which holds the manager lock across both. Done as two steps a `connect` can read the OLD record in between, and whether its tunnel is already CONNECTED or still CONNECTING when the write lands decides whether any after-the-fact sweep would notice it — so the window is removed rather than narrowed: a racing `connect` either completes before (and is torn down inside the section) or starts after (and reads the new coordinates). It also cancels and AWAITS that instance's in-flight self-heal first: recovery reads the record before it takes the lock, so a recovery already running carries the pre-edit coordinates and would reinstall a tunnel to the old machine. Because that cancellation itself awaits, a reconfiguration additionally raises a per-instance BARRIER before its first await; while the barrier is up the scheduling seams refuse to start work — `_on_tunnel_exit` will not begin a self-heal, a backed-off one returns without acting, and `_schedule_token_refresh` will not restart a mint loop — so nothing can slip into the window. Self-heal is cancelled AND awaited before the coordinates move, because it rebuilds from the record it read. The token-refresh loop is unwound by the teardown instead — after the stop succeeds — so a REJECTED edit leaves the live tunnel holding both its credential and its refresh; in both cases the cancellation is awaited, since a mint already in flight would otherwise store a token for a tunnel that is being replaced. A teardown that raises ABORTS the edit with `503` / `code: tunnel_teardown_failed` and persists nothing: a stop that failed leaves the old forward live, so advancing the record would describe one machine while the still-open tunnel serves another — and that tunnel is the one the user reaches. Nothing is discarded unless the stop succeeded — the tunnel keeps its place in `_tunnels` along with its token and refresh task — so a failed stop can neither leave an untracked process holding the port nor a live forward without a credential. The registry write is also shielded from cancellation: a client hanging up mid-write must not unwind the `async with` and free the lock while the write is still in flight. An edit sends only the fields that DIFFER from an IMMUTABLE snapshot of the record taken when its form opened (not the live polled record, which a concurrent CLI edit would move under the user), so the later of two concurrent saves cannot revert the earlier one's corrections; optional fields travel as explicit empty values, so emptying one clears it instead of being read as "leave as-is". The dashboard does NOT reconnect afterwards: any automatic reconnect races an explicit Disconnect arriving mid-save, so the row offers **Connect** instead. A crew CORRELATED to a cloud stack has its `connection_method`/`ssm_target`/`aws_profile`/`aws_region` frozen in the edit form and omitted from the request — Stop/Start/Delete resolve the machine through those, so editing them would strand a billing instance. That freeze is **dashboard-side only**: this endpoint still accepts those fields for any instance, because correlation lives in the cloud launch store rather than the registry. A non-dashboard caller (CLI, script, the agent driving this owner-only API) can therefore still rewrite the coordinates. This is a recorded ACCEPT rather than an oversight: the endpoint is owner-only, loopback-bound, SEL-audited, and rejected from the Slack path, so the caller is already the machine's owner or their own agent — and the damage is reversible by re-editing, though the EC2 instance bills until it is. Server-side enforcement is tracked separately; it needs correlation data that lives in the cloud launch store, not the registry. An SSM crew that cannot be correlated is offered no lifecycle action, so its fields stay editable — that identity is how the dashboard finds the machine to stop or delete, and editing it away would strand a billing instance. |
| `DELETE /api/instances/{id}` | Disconnect then remove. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/connect` | Open tunnel + mint token. Returns the token. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/refresh-token` | Force a fresh mint and return the new token. See below. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/disconnect` | Tear down one tunnel. |
| `GET /api/instances/{id}/status[?diagnose=1]` | Live status; `?diagnose=1` runs the failure ladder and merges the result. |
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/restart` | Restart the remote gateway over SSH. |

**Two routes cross the token boundary, not one.** `connect` and `refresh-token`
both return a minted dashboard token in their response body, and they are the
**only** two that do. `refresh-token` exists because the browser needs to replace
an embedded pane's credential without tearing the tunnel down: proactively at
~80% of the TTL for a non-active pane, and reactively when an embedded dashboard
posts `mc-auth-expired` for the active pane (rate-limited client-side to one
re-mint per instance per 10s so a persistently-rejecting remote cannot spin a
reload storm). The invariant is the same on both: the token is delivered to the
authenticated owner only, is **never logged**, and **never** appears in a list or
status payload. The count is what to keep straight, since a single-route reading
would leave `refresh-token` out of any audit of where tokens leave the gateway:
the pair is `connect` + `refresh-token`, and nothing else.

Status codes worth knowing: `503` when the manager is not running (feature
enabled after startup), `404` for an unknown id, `502` when a connect, refresh,
or remote restart fails, and `400` on invalid add/update input.

`restart` is wired end to end (route, handler, `restart_remote`, and an
`api.restartInstance` client method) but no dashboard surface calls it today, so
it is reachable only by an authenticated owner driving the API directly.

A token is stored against a tunnel GENERATION, not just against "some tunnel for
this instance". Every install bumps a per-instance counter; a mint captures the
counter before it starts (mints run without the manager lock, so a slow one must
not block connect/disconnect) and, under the lock, refuses to store its token if
the counter moved. Without that stamp the only check available is
`instance_id in self._tunnels`, which is true again for the REPLACEMENT tunnel —
so a mint in flight across an edit-plus-reconnect, or across a self-heal
reinstall, would overwrite the valid new token with one the current remote never
issued, and the embedded dashboard would be handed a dead credential. The stamp
covers every mint path rather than an enumerated list: the request-driven
`refresh_token()` the embedded dashboard calls is not a task in `_refresh_tasks`
and cannot be cancelled by name, so cancellation alone could never have reached
it. A refresh also refuses to START while the reconfiguration barrier is up,
since the coordinates it would read are about to move; the caller reports "no
token" and the client retries after the edit.

### 6.1 Why a transport edit tears the tunnel down instead of answering `409`

The obvious cheaper contract is to REFUSE a transport edit while a tunnel is live
(`409`, "disconnect first") and check-and-write under the existing lock. That
deletes `reconfigure()` and everything it carries — the per-instance barrier, the
recovery index, cancel-and-await on two task families, the shielded write — from a
manager that is already large. It was rejected for one reason: **a transport edit
is most often made because the tunnel is broken, and a broken tunnel is exactly
what does not report itself as down.** A crew whose host moved, whose port was
taken, or whose AMI runs a different remote user sits in `connected` or
`connecting` while being unusable; `409` would answer "disconnect first" to a user
who is editing precisely because connecting is what stopped working, and it hands
them a two-step where the failure mode of forgetting step one is a silent
mismatch between the record and the live forward.

The machinery is also not paid for by this feature alone. Every piece exists
because a tunnel's coordinates can change under a task that already read them —
which is equally true of the pre-existing self-heal and token-refresh loops, and
is where two of the bugs found during this PR's review actually lived. Making the
edit path safe hardened those seams rather than adding a new hazard: the barrier
is what stops a backed-off self-heal from reinstalling a tunnel to a machine the
user has moved on from, with or without an edit in flight.

What the design deliberately does NOT do is reconnect afterwards. Saving ends
disconnected and the row offers **Connect**, because any automatic reconnect races
an explicit Disconnect arriving mid-save. So the cost is bounded: the save closes
what its own edit invalidated, and never reopens anything on the user's behalf.

## 7. Security model

- **Owner-only, never via Slack.** A Slack-origin `X-Session-Key` is rejected;
  an authenticated dashboard session (`request["user"]`, set by the token-auth
  middleware) is positively required rather than assumed.
- **Loopback-only forwards.** `ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:<local>:127.0.0.1:<remote>`,
  with `AddressFamily=inet` to avoid an unexpected `::1` bind, `BatchMode=yes`
  so a missing credential fails fast instead of prompting, and
  `ExitOnForwardFailure=yes` so a forward that cannot bind is a detected failure
  rather than a silent hang. `-N` without `-f` is deliberate: `-f` would fork ssh
  into the background and leave the gateway unable to supervise or kill the real
  forwarder. The multiplexing pins in §9 close the same hole from the
  ssh_config side.
- **No local shell.** `ssh` is always spawned with an argv list, so `ssh_host`
  cannot inject local shell syntax; `ssh_host`/`remote_bin` are
  injection-validated immediately before every command line is built (§11).
- **Tokens.** Short-lived bearer tokens (`MAX_SESSION_TTL_SECS` caps the session
  at 20h) minted over SSH, returned only to the in-memory caller, never logged,
  and never present in list/status payloads. The mint's failure path carries a
  bounded stdout tail that is token-substituted and credential-redacted first,
  and the scan window is bounded because the redaction regexes hold the GIL.
- **postMessage relay.** The parent validates every embedded-frame
  `event.origin` against an exact loopback http origin (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`,
  or a single-label `*.localhost`) **and** requires the port to belong to a
  currently-warm tunnel before trusting any message. Only four message kinds
  cross the boundary: an unread count, an auth-expired signal, a switch-pane
  request (whose target is re-validated against the known instance list), and a
  readiness ping. The parent's outbound `postMessage` is addressed to the pane's
  exact origin, never `*`.
- **CSP.** `frame-ancestors` is `'self'` plus the exact parent origin carried in
  the minted token's signed `embed_parent_port` claim, never a wildcard and never
  a hardcoded port, so a local page with no validly-signed token can never frame
  the dashboard.
- **Untrusted ssh stderr.** A proxy banner is ANSI-stripped, credential- and
  exfiltration-redacted, and truncated before it is surfaced in status, and it is
  a secondary detail only: failure *classification* keys on real ssh signals, so
  banner prose can never be read as an auth verdict.
- **Trust root.** `<data-home>/run/` (the run-marker dir) is on the
  `is_sensitive_path` floor, so agent file tools can neither read nor write it.
  See §12 and [security.md](security.md).
- **SEL audit trail.** Every control-plane action is audited, reads included.

## 8. Using it (step by step)

1. **Enable** on the hub: `kirocrew config set instances.enabled true && kirocrew restart`
   (or the Settings → Instances toggle, then a restart).
2. Open the dashboard and go to **Settings → Instances**. This panel is the
   control plane only; it does not embed remote dashboards.
3. **Add** an instance:
   - *Name*: any label.
   - *SSH host / alias*: what you would type after `ssh` (see §9).
   - *Remote port*: the port the remote gateway listens on. It must be unique
     across instances, because the local forward mirrors it.
   - *Token TTL*: default `20h`.
   - *Remote kirocrew path*: only needed when `kirocrew` lives somewhere
     non-standard on the remote.
4. Click **Connect**. The hub opens the tunnel and mints a token.
5. **Switch** panes from the switcher dropdown in the top header (**Local**
   returns to your own dashboard). In the Electron shell, Cmd/Ctrl+digit jumps
   between panes in switcher order. Each row names its tunnel state in words on
   screen next to the status dot — colour is reinforcement, not the carrier, so
   the row that errored is findable without hovering every entry. Crews you switch
   between often can be PINNED beside the trigger as chips, so the switch costs no
   dropdown click — see [Pinned crew chips](#pinned-crew-chips).
6. **Diagnose** a flaky instance (runs the ladder), or **Disconnect** from its
   row. **Edit settings** / **Remove** live in the row's overflow menu — a row
   shows two primary actions plus that menu, so everything past them is one
   menu deep.

An unsaved edit is held by the PANEL, keyed by crew, not by the form component.
The crew list unmounts for any number of reasons the form cannot see — switching
to the **Set up a new one** tab is enough — and an edit whose only home was the
form's own state came back silently reverted to the stored record. Because a
guard can only refuse the exits it enumerates, the values are lifted instead of
defended: the form is re-seeded from that draft when it remounts. The draft carries
its **baseline** — the record it was typed against — and not just the values:
re-deriving the baseline from the current `inst` on remount would rebase a stale
draft onto a newer poll, so a port someone changed from the CLI meanwhile would
read as a difference and be written back to its old value by a save the user
thought only touched the host. One snapshot anchors everything: `dirty` and the
request body both measure against that baseline, so a restored draft is unsaved
work rather than a clean form, and a field the user never touched is never a
difference. Only three things clear it: **Cancel** (the user choosing
to discard), a successful save, and the crew ceasing to exist. That last one is
anchored to the crew's EXISTENCE rather than to the Remove button, so a removal
from the CLI or a cloud Delete clears it too — ids are derived from the name, so a
crew added afterwards can land on the same id, and a surviving draft would remount
on a different machine and let Save overwrite settings the user never typed. It is
gated on a SUCCESSFUL poll, so an errored fetch is not read as "all crews gone"
and does not throw unsaved work away.

A live id is not proof of a live RECORD, though: a crew removed and recreated under
the same derived id between two polls never leaves the list. So the draft is also
checked against the record's **machine-addressing** fields (`connection_method`,
`ssh_host`, `remote_port`, `ssm_target`, `aws_profile`, `aws_region`). When one of
those moved externally, the form says so, names the fields, and **withholds Save**
until the user adopts the current record. This is deliberately not a silent choice
either way, because the two situations that produce the signal are
indistinguishable from the client and want opposite outcomes: a concurrent CLI edit
should keep the user's typing, while a replacement must never receive it — only the
person looking at the row can tell which happened. A label or lifetime changed
elsewhere does NOT trigger it: that cannot make this a different crew, and the
baseline diff already stops the save from reverting it.

Adopting the record is a **three-way merge**, with the draft's original baseline as
the merge base: fields the user typed are kept, every field they did not touch is
taken from the record that exists now, and the baseline advances to it. Keeping the
old values wholesale would convert untouched-but-stale fields into deliberate
writes — the very clobber the baseline exists to prevent.

A save that tore the tunnel down also drops the crew's WARM pane. That pane is an
iframe holding the old local port and token, so once the tunnel behind it is gone
it cannot be revived by reconnecting — it would reuse a credential the new tunnel
never issued and sit on 403. The decision reads the saved record's own status
rather than guessing from which fields changed, so a name-or-ttl-only edit (which
tears nothing down) keeps its working pane. Opening a DIFFERENT crew's editor while one
holds unsaved changes is still refused outright — that is about two editors being
open at once, not about the unmount — and the refusal renders at the row that was
clicked, since the menu has already closed by then.

### Pinned crew chips

Switching between two crews through the dropdown costs a click every time. Any
entry — including **Local** — can be PINNED from the dropdown's *Pin crews*
section, which lifts it out of the menu into an always-visible chip beside the
trigger. Nothing is pinned by default, so a single-crew user pays no header width
for the feature and sees no chip row at all.

Pinning is per crew rather than one expand-everything switch because the header's
budget is a PIXEL budget, not a crew count: three crews named after real hosts
outgrow it while six short names fit. Choosing WHICH crews are worth header space
is what keeps that budget spendable on the ones actually being switched between.

| Concern | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Storage | `localStorage` key `mc-crew-switcher-pinned`, a JSON array of instance ids (`__local__` for the local dashboard). A module-level store broadcasts changes, because several bars in one realm are mounted at once and hidden with `display:none` rather than unmounted — a per-component hook would leave a hidden bar on a stale value until it remounted. A remote pane's embedded bar is a separate cross-origin realm and so carries its own pin set. |
| Migration | The predecessor was one expand-everything flag, `mc-crew-switcher-expanded`. On first read a `'1'` there migrates to a pinned **Local** rather than to an empty set: that user wanted chips, and migrating them to nothing would read as the feature having been removed. The legacy key is dropped in the same pass. |
| Order | The crew on screen leads as its own chip, then the pinned chips, then the dropdown. The dropdown TRAILS the chips so it stays adjacent to the last one and reads as "and the rest"; it carries the aggregate unread for every crew not on screen, clipped ones included. The active crew is never also a pinned chip — two copies of one name would spend the budget twice. |
| Width bound | None of its own. The switcher sits in the topbar's left grid track (`minmax(0,1fr)`) inside `.tb-left`, which carries `min-width:0` and `overflow:hidden`, so the track structurally prevents it from reaching the centered search column — see [the three-track topbar](#pinned-crew-chips). Earlier revisions of this feature carried a `vw`-derived `max-width` because the search overlay was absolutely positioned and a left-side cluster could squeeze it; the grid layout removed that failure mode along with the need for the cap. |
| Overflow | The row is a single `nowrap` line with `overflow: hidden`, and the chip at the boundary is CUT rather than dropped. Wrapping into a hidden second row would keep every chip whole, but a wrapped row still holds its full ALLOCATED width with the wrapped chips' space empty — which pushes the trailing dropdown away from the last visible chip by a gap that changes with the viewport. Filling the row keeps the two adjacent (measured at the 4px flex gap, asserted by the capture harness). A trailing fade marks the cut edge, so a cut chip reads as "there is more, in the dropdown next to me" rather than as a rendering fault. Cut chips stay reachable in the dropdown, whose row marks them *no room* so a pin with no visible chip does not read as a pin that failed. |

**Why the switcher needs no width cap.** The topbar is a three-track CSS grid:
`minmax(0,1fr) | clamp(240px,22vw,480px) | minmax(0,1fr)`. The search column is a
flow-internal track, not an absolutely positioned overlay, so a wide left cluster
cannot reach it: `.tb-left` is `min-width:0` with `overflow:hidden`, and the track
simply gives the chips less room. That is the whole bound, and it holds at every
viewport width and under the macOS Electron 84px header inset (which narrows the
tracks rather than shifting content over them).

This is worth stating because the obvious alternative is wrong in a way that
already shipped once: a hardcoded fraction. `max-w-[42vw]` on the chip row reached
~538px at 1280px, which under the previous absolutely-positioned search overlay
pushed its available space under the minimum width and unmounted it outright. A
fraction cannot track a viewport-relative sibling; a grid track does it by
construction.


Counting which chips were cut off is read-only and one-directional: the result is
consumed only by the dropdown's rows, which are portalled and contribute nothing
to the header's width, so nothing sized by the measurement lives inside the thing
being measured. The dropdown's own unread badge is absolutely positioned for the
same reason — appearing must not change the button's width, since the chip row is
sized from the space that button leaves. The rule itself (a chip whose trailing
edge passes the row's visible width is cut) is a pure function, `clippedChipIds`,
because jsdom performs no layout and a rendered test could never distinguish a
fitted row from a clipped one. `offsetLeft` is only sound there because the row
carries `position: relative`, making it the chips' offsetParent and putting both
in the same coordinate space as its `clientWidth`.

## 9. Remote host types

The only thing that varies per remote is the **SSH host** you configure: the hub
always runs a fixed `ssh <ssh_host> ...` argv (`BatchMode=yes`,
`ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`, `ServerAliveInterval=30`, `ServerAliveCountMax=3`,
`AddressFamily=inet`, `ControlPath=none`, `ControlMaster=no`, `-L`/`-N`, plus `-C` <!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
when compression is on). Anything `ssh` can reach **non-interactively** works.
`ssh_host` accepts `host`, `host.fqdn`, an `~/.ssh/config` alias, or
`user@host`, and rejects any segment starting with `-` (ssh option-injection
guard).

**Multiplexing is pinned off; everything else is inherited.** A tunnel is a
supervised foreground child, and a forward the gateway cannot supervise or kill
reports as `ssh exited with code 0` while it is in fact still serving. A
multiplexed session does exactly that — ssh hands the forward to an existing
shared connection and exits. `ControlPath=none` is the enforcement: with no path
resolved there is no socket to join. `ControlMaster=no` states the policy, and <!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
is not sufficient alone — an inherited `ControlPath` still routes into a shared
connection.

Everything else per-host — `User`, `IdentityFile`, `Port`, `ProxyJump`,
`ProxyCommand` — is still inherited from `~/.ssh/config`; the registry carries no
inline equivalents and depends on that. **Pinning a directive the user may also
set is not free**: ssh takes the first value obtained and reads the command line
first, so a pinned `-o` silently discards theirs. The two multiplexing pins are
safe because a supervised tunnel must never share a connection, but the same
move on, say, `IgnoreUnknown` would drop the pattern a cross-platform config
relies on and turn a working setup into `Bad configuration option`.

The diagnostics probes are a different case and are left alone: they are
one-shot commands whose exit status is the whole result, with no forward to own.

### Dev host / home server (primary)

Use your SSH config alias or `user@hostname`. As long as a key in your
`ssh-agent` (or the default identity) covers auth, `BatchMode` succeeds without
prompting and no key path is needed.

### EC2 (and other key-based hosts)

EC2 differs from a directly-reachable dev host in three ways that matter here:

| Aspect | Direct dev host | EC2 |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| Auth | key in `ssh-agent` / default identity | key pair (`-i key.pem`), or SSM Session Manager |
| Login user | resolved by your ssh config | `ec2-user`, `ubuntu`, `admin`, and so on: must be explicit |
| Reachability | direct | often via a bastion (ProxyJump) or SSM-only (no public SSH) |

**Recommended: configure an SSH alias.** Because `ssh_host` accepts an alias, put
the EC2-specific bits in `~/.ssh/config` on the **hub** and reference the alias.
The fixed `ssh <alias> ...` argv inherits all of it:

```ssh-config
# ~/.ssh/config on the hub
Host my-ec2
  HostName ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  User ec2-user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my-key.pem
  # Optional: reach a private instance through a bastion ...
  ProxyJump bastion-host
  # ... or via SSM Session Manager (no inbound SSH needed):
  # ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters portNumber=%p"
```

Then add an instance with **SSH host / alias = `my-ec2`**. Prerequisites on the
hub: a passphrase-less key (or an `ssh-agent` already holding it, since
`BatchMode` will not prompt), and `kirocrew` installed with a gateway running on
the instance's loopback port.

Simpler cases work without an alias: `ec2-user@10.0.1.5` and
`ubuntu@ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com` are both accepted `ssh_host`
values, provided the matching key is the default identity or in the agent.

**The cloud launcher registers instances here.** `kirocrew cloud launch`
best-effort registers the box it created in this registry using the **native SSM
transport** — `connection_method="ssm"` with the EC2 instance id as `ssm_target`,
plus the launcher's `aws_profile`/`aws_region` (`cloud/connect.py:register_instance`).
The dashboard then tunnels, refreshes tokens, and self-heals the box over SSM with
no SSH key, no inbound port, and no hand-edited `~/.ssh/config`. `kirocrew cloud
destroy` unregisters it (matched by `ssm_target`) after deletion confirms. This is
why `cloud/connect.py` cites this section, and why its numbering must not move.
The legacy `ssm_proxy_ssh_host` helper (registering the id as `ssh_host` behind an
`~/.ssh/config` `ProxyCommand`) is retained for reference only and is no longer
used by the managed path.

### Provisioning from the dashboard (`/api/cloud/*`)

The Remote Crew settings page can create an EC2 crew in the user's own AWS
account without dropping to the CLI. `dashboard/handlers_cloud.py` exposes the
launcher behind the same owner-only guard as `/api/instances/*`: an
authenticated owner (`request["user"]`), non-Slack, POSIX only, `403` otherwise.

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/cloud/preflight?profile=&region=` | AWS reachability + the prerequisite checklist (the doctor checks as JSON). |
| `GET /api/cloud/iam-policy` | The minimum IAM policy document to paste into the user's account. |
| `GET /api/cloud/launch` | List launch jobs, in progress and finished. |
| `POST /api/cloud/launch` | Start a launch job; returns the job immediately. `409` when one is already in flight. |
| `GET /api/cloud/launch/{id}` | Poll one job: per-step state plus the device-code prompt while signing in. |
| `POST /api/cloud/launch/{id}/cancel` | Request cancellation; honored between steps and inside the sign-in wait. A cancel during provisioning is acted on when the deploy returns, and the stack it created is rolled back. |
| `POST /api/cloud/launch/{id}/signin` | Acknowledge the device-code prompt (`409` when none is pending). |
| `POST /api/cloud/{tag}/stop` | Stop the instance behind a stack tag. |
| `POST /api/cloud/{tag}/start` | Start it again. |
| `DELETE /api/cloud/{tag}` | Terminate the stack (`wait=False`; a denied human-action check surfaces as `403`). |

**A launch is a durable job, not a request.** It outlives both the HTTP call and
the browser tab: `cloud/launch_job.py` writes one JSON file per job under
`<config_dir>/run/cloud-launch-jobs/` (the `run/` tree is on the sensitive-path
floor, so an awaiting-sign-in job's device code is not readable by agent file
tools) and rewrites it after **every** state
transition, so progress survives navigating away and a reload. The steps are
`preflight → provision → signin → connect`, and
`RealLaunchEngine` (`cloud/launch_engine.py`) binds them to the existing
`iam.reachability_check`, `ec2.deploy`, `login.start_device_login` and
`connect.register_instance` — the dashboard path adds no AWS logic of its own,
and registration lands in this registry exactly as the CLI's does.

**A restart does not resume a launch — it terminalizes it.** The worker is a
daemon thread, so a gateway restart takes it with the process while the job file
still reads `running`. `LaunchJobStore.reap_orphans()` runs on first store use in
a new process and marks every non-terminal job it does not own as `failed`
("interrupted"), because the alternative is worse than an error: a progress card
that can never advance, and a `cancel` that returns 200 while signalling a thread
that no longer exists. Ownership is tracked (`adopt()`) so a live process never
reaps its own in-flight jobs. The CloudFormation stack may well have completed in
AWS, so the message points the user at their crew list rather than implying
nothing was created.

Because the gateway cannot answer the device login on the user's behalf, a job
parks in `awaiting_signin` with the verification URL and user code exposed as
job state until the owner confirms it in the browser.

### What is reachable through which mechanism

| Need | Where it goes |
|------|---------------|
| Custom login user | `user@host` in `ssh_host`, or `User` in an ssh-config `Host` block |
| FQDN / IP target | direct `ssh_host` value |
| Identity file | `IdentityFile` in an ssh-config `Host` block (there is no inline field) |
| Non-22 SSH port | `Port` in an ssh-config `Host` block (there is no inline field) |
| Bastion / ProxyJump | `ProxyJump` / `ProxyCommand` in an ssh-config `Host` block |
| SSM-only instances | `ProxyCommand` with `aws ssm start-session` |

The registry deliberately carries no inline `-i` / `-p` / `-J` fields. The
ssh-config alias path covers every case above, including bastions and SSM, which
inline flags could not express, and it keeps the hub's argv fixed: a
user-controlled `-i` path would be a new injection surface on a command line
whose current variable parts are all charset-bound literals.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---------|--------------------|
| Settings → Instances shows the opt-in card | `instances.enabled` is false. Set it and restart. |
| Enabled but the panel says "not active" | The flag was set after the gateway started; the SSH manager is created at startup only. Restart. |
| Iframe is blank or black | The pane's embedded SPA never announced readiness within 15s, so the error panel with **Retry** appears (Retry force-reloads even an identical src). An iframe reports no load error to its parent, so this watchdog is the only signal. |
| Connect fails with an SSH auth error | Refresh your SSH credentials (re-add the key to `ssh-agent`); `BatchMode` never prompts, so a missing credential is an immediate failure. Tunnels self-heal once auth is restored. |
| Connect fails for another reason | Use **Diagnose**. The ladder reports the first broken link: `ssh_unreachable` (check SSH access or the host alias), `remote_down` (remote gateway not listening), `not_connected` (SSH and remote are fine, this instance has no tunnel yet: click Connect), or `tunnel_down` (reconnect). |
| "local port N is already in use" | The forward mirrors the remote port, so two instances cannot share one. Change this instance's remote port (and the remote gateway's own port to match), or stop whatever holds the port. |
| Instance keeps dropping | The health probe plus 2-tier self-heal retry over roughly a two-minute window (8 attempts, capped-exponential backoff). Tune `instances.max_recovery_attempts` / `recover_backoff_max_secs` / `probe_failure_threshold`; both recovery values are clamped so they cannot loop indefinitely. If self-heal gives up, diagnosis runs automatically. Check the remote gateway and SSH stability. |
| A pane vanished from the warm set but its switcher entry is still there | It was LRU-evicted (warm set full). The tunnel is untouched: selecting the crew re-warms it. Raise `instances.warm_set_cap` if you want more panes resident. |
| Every token mint fails on one remote, though its gateway is healthy | The remote's `~/.local/bin/kirocrew` probably points at an uninstalled checkout. See §12: the run-marker is what makes mint follow the *running* gateway's install. |

---

## 11. Input validation (`validation.py`)

`instances/validation.py` is the **authoritative** injection guard for the two
user-controlled strings that reach an `ssh` command line. It lives next to the
tunnel manager rather than in the registry on purpose: the registry's
`_SSH_HOST_RE` / `_REMOTE_BIN_RE` checks are an *early reject* for obviously
malformed input at add/update time, while these functions run immediately before
each command line is built, which is the only point where the value is actually
dangerous. That ordering matters because the registry's load path
(`Instance.from_dict`) is deliberately tolerant and does **not** validate, so a
hand-edited or hand-migrated `instances.json` can hold anything at all until one
of these functions sees it.

Two distinct attacks, two distinct rules:

- `validate_ssh_host()` closes **ssh option injection**. Even with no local
  shell, an `ssh_host` like `-oProxyCommand=...` is parsed by ssh as an *option*
  and can run an arbitrary local command. It therefore rejects an empty value,
  anything over 255 chars, more than one `@`, an empty user or host segment, any
  segment beginning with `-`, and any character outside
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` (with the segment required to start with a letter, digit or
  underscore). It returns the stripped host so callers use the validated form.
- `validate_remote_bin()` closes **remote shell injection**. `remote_bin` is
  embedded, double-quoted, into the single command string the *remote* shell
  evaluates, so it forbids every shell metacharacter, `$` included (no command
  substitution or expansion the gateway does not control), and bounds the value
  to 512 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9._/~ -]`. An empty string is legal and means "use
  the candidate search".

Failures raise `SshValidationError` (a `ValueError`).

Where it is called, and what each caller does with a rejection:

| Caller | Behavior on rejection |
|--------|----------------------|
| `SshTunnelManager.connect()` | Returns an ERROR status carrying "invalid ssh settings", retained in `_last_error` so the switcher entry can explain itself. |
| `SshTunnelManager._recover()` | Aborts self-heal for that instance with a warning (no point retrying an unusable record). |
| `SshTunnelManager._refresh_token_once()` | Aborts the refresh with a warning. |
| `SshTunnelManager.restart_remote()` | Returns `{ok: false, message: "invalid ssh settings: ..."}`. |
| `diagnostics.diagnose_instance()` | Short-circuits to an `unknown` diagnosis with a clear reason, **before** spawning any `ssh`. |

The remaining variable parts of the remote command are bounded by their own
validators in `token_mint.py`: `_validate_ttl` (`<1-4 digits>[hm]`) and
`_validate_port` (an int in 1-65535). The bin candidates and the data-home path
segments are trusted module constants.

---

## 12. The gateway run-marker (`run_marker.py`)

`instances/run_marker.py` writes and reads
`<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.bin` (the running gateway's own `kirocrew`
launcher path) and `<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.pid` (its pid). It has two
unrelated consumers, and separating them is the point of the module.

### Consumer 1: remote token mint targets the running gateway's install

Token mint SSHes to the remote and resolves `kirocrew` from a fixed PATH
candidate list whose first entry is `$HOME/.local/bin/kirocrew`. When that
launcher symlinks into an *uninstalled* checkout (no `.venv`), every mint fails
even though the gateway itself is healthy, because the gateway runs from a
different venv. Rebuilding and restarting the gateway does not fix mint, since
mint never consults the gateway's own install, and the refresh loop then fails on
every cycle, which surfaces to the user as a pane that periodically disconnects
and reconnects.

The fix: at startup the gateway records the absolute path to *its own* launcher,
keyed by the port it serves. The mint shell snippet reads that marker first and,
when it names an executable file, `exec`s it, so mint uses the same venv as the
live gateway. The snippet probes three data homes in priority order, since the
remote's non-interactive SSH shell usually does not export `KIROCREW_HOME`:

1. `$KIROCREW_HOME` when set and non-empty,
2. `$HOME/<CONFIG_DIR_NAME>` (the current default, `.kiro/crew`),
3. `$HOME/<LEGACY_CONFIG_DIR_NAME>` (`.kirocrew`, for a not-yet-migrated remote).

Those two home segments are **interpolated from the shared
`kiro_crew.config.paths` constants**, the same ones the marker *writer* derives
its default from, so reader and writer cannot drift apart on a future data-home
rename. An absent or stale marker, or one that does not name an executable, falls
through to the candidate search, so nothing regresses on an older remote. An
explicit `remote_bin` is never overridden by the marker: it is the user's
deliberate choice.

`restart_remote()` resolves `kirocrew restart` through the same path, keyed by
the instance's `remote_port`.

The launcher path is derived from `sys.executable`'s sibling console script
(`kirocrew`, or `kirocrew.exe` on Windows) and is deliberately **not** resolved
through symlinks, because the console script sits next to the possibly-symlinked
interpreter in the venv's `bin/`, not next to the real interpreter. When no such
script exists (a source-tree `python -m kiro_crew` launch) the marker is written
**empty**: the mint clause requires a non-empty executable path so an empty
marker is inert there, but the *filename* still matters to consumer 2.

### Consumer 2: zero-config client port discovery

The marker's filename advertises which port a gateway serves, so `marker_ports()`
lets a local client command (`token` / `status` / `logout` / `stop`, via
`port_resolution.resolve_client_port`) find a gateway on a non-default port with no
configuration. That path reads only the filename and ignores marker *contents*
entirely. Resolution order is `--port`, then `KIROCREW_PORT`, then a port named
by `dashboard.url`, then the sole gateway-owned marker, then the default 5476.

**A marker is not proof a gateway is there.** `clear_marker()` runs only on
graceful shutdown, so a crash or SIGKILL leaves the file behind and an unrelated
process may since have bound that port. Because client commands send the local
secret (`X-Local-Secret`) to whatever answers, the consumer must verify the
listener before trusting a discovered port. `port_resolution._gateway_owns_port()`
does that in four fail-closed steps: the recorded pid must exist, must be among
`platform_compat.find_listening_pids(port)`, must be owned by the caller's uid
(which closes pid recycling into another user's process), and must look like a
gateway by argv (defense in depth only, never the sole proof). Discovery is
skipped outright on non-POSIX hosts, where no owner can be reported and the
file-permission argument does not hold, so Windows users keep `--port` /
`KIROCREW_PORT`. This module deliberately offers no bare "is something
listening" helper, so no caller can mistake reachability for identity.

The live gateway prunes markers naming other ports on startup, EXCEPT any whose
gateway passes the same ownership proof its readers use. `gateway.lock` makes a
gateway a singleton per data home only when every start goes through it, and in
practice one machine runs several that share a home (a second gateway launched by
hand, one started from another checkout that inherits the default data home, a
cutover overlapping its predecessor). A blanket prune deletes a LIVE gateway's
marker and pid sidecar, which makes it undiscoverable to `token` / `status` /
`stop` and destroys the evidence section 12.1 depends on. The ownership check fails
closed by RETURNING FALSE rather than raising -- non-POSIX returns False outright,
and a missing or throwing listener-lookup tool is folded into False as well -- so a
False answer means "ownership not proven", NOT "process gone", and the two cases are
indistinguishable from the caller. Such a marker still prunes, so markers do not
accumulate forever -- but the prune removes only the marker and pid sidecar, never
the credential, because treating False as death would strip a LIVE incumbent's
credential on every Windows host and push its clients onto a shared file a newcomer
may have replaced. `clear_marker()` owns credential deletion.

### 12.1 The internal-API credential is keyed by port

`<data-home>/run/gateway-<port>.secret` holds the internal-API credential of the
gateway serving that port, written `0600` beside the marker and removed by
`clear_marker()` with it.

The credential is generated per gateway start (`os.urandom(16).hex()`) and kept in
memory as the value the auth middleware compares against, so it identifies ONE
generation. Published only to the single shared `<data-home>/.local_secret`, it
was last-writer-wins per home: a second gateway starting in the same home replaced
the file while the first kept serving the port, the incumbent went on comparing
against its own in-memory value, and every internal caller then sent the
newcomer's credential to the incumbent. The whole internal channel answers 403
with a body of exactly `Forbidden` until one of them restarts: `learn_add`,
`spawn`, `session-keepalive`, artifact writes, the task runner, all at once, with
no warning and no metric.

Two rules keep the two halves paired:

- **The writer** (`dashboard.server._write_instance_credentials`) always writes the
  per-port file, and writes the shared `.local_secret` only when no other gateway
  in the home is verifiably alive on a different port. The shared file is still
  written in the single-instance case because pre-per-port readers (an older CLI,
  a cron script from a previous install) know only that path.
- **The reader** is ONE shared helper, `config.loader.read_local_secret(port)`: it
  returns the credential for the port the caller is about to dial and falls back to
  `.local_secret` when no per-port file exists. It lives there rather than in each
  reader because every surface that implements its own read reintroduces the bug for
  itself. **`port` is required.** An optional port would resolve the dial target from
  process context, so a converted call site could read the credential for one gateway
  while dialing another -- the same desync, reintroduced one call site at a time and
  invisible in the hunk under review. A caller with no port resolves one explicitly
  and passes it, where the choice is reviewable. `mcp_core`, `mcp_shared`,
  `cron_script`, `computer_use/screencast` and the Sage review driver each name their
  dial target; a test greps for a no-argument call so the shape cannot come back.
- **The dialed port's own credential outranks any path a caller names.**
  `cron_trigger.trigger_cron_job` reads the per-port credential for the port it posts
  to FIRST, and falls back to the `secret_path` its caller named only when that is
  absent. The order is deliberate and is dictated by the callers: both of them pass
  `config_dir() / ".local_secret"`, the home-wide file, which is exactly the file a
  second gateway generation replaces -- so preferring the named path would reinstate
  the defect this module exists to prevent.
  The cost of that order, stated rather than hidden: a crash-orphaned
  `run/gateway-<port>.secret` (the prune never deletes credentials, see section 12)
  is preferred over a correct named path, so a caller that genuinely names another
  home's credential for a port this home once served would send the stale one and get
  a 403. No caller does that today -- both name the ambient home-wide file -- and
  closing it properly means the credential-path parameter going away rather than the
  order flipping.

A denial carries a machine-readable `code` (`internal_auth_mismatch`) beside the
prose, because a genuine permission denial produces the same `Forbidden` body and a
consumer matching on text misdiagnoses one as the other. It also names both sides by
fingerprint (a short SHA-256 prefix plus length, never the value), so a
cross-generation mismatch is distinguishable from a forged header and from a caller
that had no credential at all; without it a real desync is unattributable from the
log.

### Why `run/` is on the sensitive-path floor

The marker names a path that the gateway `exec`s on the remote host **outside**
the agent sandbox, and `run/` also holds the sandbox launcher scripts. An agent
that could write into this dir could point a marker at an attacker-controlled
binary and get it executed unsandboxed on the next routine token refresh: a
reachable sandbox escape, which the owner and `-x` checks do not stop because
agent writes run as the same user. `run/` is therefore classified read+write
sensitive in `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`, under every known data-home prefix.
The dir is created `0700` (re-applied on an existing dir, since `exist_ok` does
not re-apply mode) and both files are written `0600` through the shared
`atomic_write` helper, whose unique `mkstemp` + `os.replace` closes the
same-user symlink TOCTOU a predictable `<name>.tmp` would leave open. Every
legitimate writer opens these paths directly and does not route through the file
gate, so gateway startup and spawn are unaffected.

---

## 13. The SSM connection method (`connection_method`)

Each instance record carries a `connection_method`: `"ssh"` (default) or `"ssm"`.
SSM tunnels over AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, so it needs no inbound
port, no sshd and no distributed key — reachability is an IAM decision
(`ssm:StartSession` on the instance ARN) rather than a network one.

| Method | Tunnel command | Client prerequisites | Mint path |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| `ssh` (default) | `ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:LP:127.0.0.1:RP <ssh_host>` | non-interactive SSH access | `ssh <host> kirocrew token` |
| `ssm` | `aws ssm start-session --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --target <ssm_target> --parameters portNumber=RP,localPortNumber=LP` | AWS CLI + `session-manager-plugin`; `ssm:StartSession`, `ssm:SendCommand`, `ssm:GetCommandInvocation` | `aws ssm send-command` → `kirocrew token` |

Records are back-compatible: an `instances.json` written before this feature has
no `connection_method` and loads as `"ssh"`.

SSM-only registry fields: `ssm_target` (an EC2 `i-…` or SSM managed-instance
`mi-…` id), plus optional `aws_profile`, `aws_region` and `ssm_run_as`. Only the
profile **name** is persisted — never a credential; the AWS CLI resolves
credentials via its own provider chain.

`ssm_run_as` is the **remote POSIX user** SSM commands run as: `cloud.ssm.run_command`
wraps every remote command in `sudo -u <user> -i bash`, and its default
(`ec2-user`) is a *launcher* assumption that holds only for provisioned AL2023
boxes. Without a per-instance override, an Ubuntu AMI would bring the tunnel up
and then fail the mint — and, because the readiness probe also runs through that
same wrapper, `diagnose_instance_ssm` would report `remote_down` for a perfectly
healthy remote gateway. The field defaults to `ec2-user` (so existing records and
launcher-provisioned boxes are unaffected), is charset-validated as a Unix
username like the other SSM coordinates, and an empty value resolves to the
default rather than emitting a bare `sudo -u ''`.

### One state machine, two transports

`_SshTunnel` builds either argv from the same class, and `_TransportParams`
(resolved once per operation by `_resolve_transport`) carries the validated
per-transport values so `connect` / `_rebuild` / `_recover` /
`_refresh_token_once` / `restart_remote` share one code path. The health probe,
2-tier self-heal, proactive refresh, stored-token liveness probe and startup
auto-revive are transport-agnostic.

Two SSM-specific behaviours:

- **Process-tree teardown (all platforms).** The SSM child gets process-group
  isolation at spawn — `start_new_session` on POSIX, `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
  on Windows, passed explicitly per the `platform_compat` recipe — and teardown
  reaps the whole tree through `platform_compat.kill_process_tree` (`killpg`
  POSIX / `taskkill /T` Windows). This matters because the
  `session-manager-plugin` grandchild is what actually holds the forwarded port:
  `terminate()` on the `aws` wrapper alone orphans it and wedges the port. Doing
  this with raw `os.killpg`/`os.getpgid` would silently degrade to
  wrapper-only termination on Windows, which Kiro Crew supports.
- **Readiness timeout.** `session-manager-plugin` completes a WebSocket handshake
  with the SSM service before binding, so the SSM transport uses a longer default
  connect timeout than a direct ssh TCP connect. An explicit caller-supplied
  timeout still wins for both.

`_ssm_exit_error` classifies the child's exit with SSM vocabulary (expired
credentials, `ssm:StartSession` denial, missing plugin, target not a connected
managed node, local bind conflict) rather than running SSM stderr through the ssh
auth/transport matchers, which would mislabel an `AccessDenied` as an ssh auth
failure.

### Diagnosis ladder

`diagnose_instance_ssm` mirrors the SSH ladder with an SSM first rung, so an
offline agent is not reported as a dead remote gateway:

1. managed node online? (`describe-instance-information`) → no ⇒ `ssm_unreachable`
2. remote dashboard up? (`send-command` + curl on the remote loopback) → no ⇒ `remote_down`
3. local forward reachable? → no ⇒ `tunnel_down`, else `ok`

`ssm_unreachable` is a new diagnosis code; the shared rungs reuse SSM-worded
reasons so the copy never tells an SSM user to "check SSH access".

### Reuse of the launcher's SSM primitives

Argv building and remote execution delegate to `cloud.ssm`
(`build_port_forward_argv`, `run_command`) rather than duplicating them, so the
two features cannot drift on the SSM document or parameter shape. Those calls run
in the gateway process, which has no `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`, so the launcher's
agent-session chokepoint does not apply; the `hooks.py` denied-command list gates
agent *tool* calls and likewise does not gate the gateway's own children.

### Trade-off: the mint transits SSM command history

The mint runs over `send-command`, so the token appears in that invocation's
output, which SSM retains for up to 30 days and is readable with
`ssm:GetCommandInvocation`. It is **not** in CloudTrail (which records the API
call, not the output), and no S3/CloudWatch output destination is configured.

Bounded by: the token is TTL-capped and only usable against the remote's
loopback, so *using* it requires `ssm:StartSession` — a superset of the access
needed to read the history. The generated launcher policy also withholds
`ssm:ListCommandInvocations`, so a holder cannot enumerate command ids hunting
for tokens. The SSH transport has no equivalent exposure. This mirrors the
accepted posture in `cloud/connect.py::mint_token`.

`ssm_token_mint.py` is listed in `security_posture.NON_EGRESS_REDACTION_MODULES`
alongside its SSH sibling: it redacts remote output on the way into an exception,
which is not an egress boundary.

### Interaction with §9

§9 documents reaching an SSM-only instance through an `~/.ssh/config`
`ProxyCommand` — still valid as a manual option, and still `connection_method="ssh"`:
the reachability lives in ssh config and Kiro Crew is unaware of it.
`connection_method="ssm"` is the direct alternative, requiring neither sshd nor a
key on the remote — and it is now what `cloud/connect.py`'s registry integration
uses (`register_instance` sets `connection_method="ssm"`, `ssm_target=<instance-id>`).
The legacy `ssm_proxy_ssh_host` helper is kept for reference only.

## 14. Session transfer (send a session to another instance)

Copies one dashboard session from this instance to a connected peer. The user
picks it from any session menu: **Send a copy to ▸ `<instance>`**.

Code: `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/session_transfer.py` (bundle + importer),
`SshTunnelManager.send_session_bundle` (delivery),
`handlers_instances.api_instances_send_session` (control plane), and the frontend
`SendToInstanceSubmenu` mounted inside the shared `SessionActionsMenu`.

### 14.1 Why it needs no new transport

A session is a portable JSONL transcript (`<data-home>/sessions/<key>.jsonl`:
a metadata line then `{role, content, ts}` records) and the receiving side
already knows how to turn one into a live tab — that is what
`chat_persistence` does on every gateway restart. So a transfer reuses two
things that exist: the tunnel from §4 and the rehydrate path.

The gateway binds loopback unconditionally (`dashboard/urls.py:is_local_only`
always returns `True` in the public build), so an instance tunnel is the only
sanctioned way to reach a peer. Nothing here opens a socket.

### 14.1a Two layers — and why Layer B is what makes resume real

The transcript above is only the **display** copy (*Layer A*). The context the
model actually holds — the compaction/turn state, keyed by a kiro-cli session id
— lives in a **second store outside the crew home**:
`kiro_sessions_dir()/<sid>.json` + `<sid>.jsonl`, joined to a slot through
`session_map.json`. Call it *Layer B*.

This split is the whole fidelity story. Ship Layer A alone and the peer has a
browsable history but no resumable context: `SessionMap.get` finds no usable sid
and the next turn falls back to `_build_history_prefix()`, a condensed ~8K-char
text prefix — no tool state, no real context window. Ship Layer B too and the
peer resumes through `session/load` under its own fresh sid, which is the same
fidelity a local gateway restart gives.

So `bundle_version` 2 carries an optional `layer_b`. It is **optional by
design**: a v1 sender, or a session that never opened a kiro-cli context, ships
Layer A only and the peer degrades to the prefix. Both versions stay accepted so
a newer instance can still receive from an older one.

On import Layer B's **host-naming fields** are rewritten — a fresh `sid`
(so copy-never-move holds and a repeat send cannot collide), `cwd` and the
filesystem `allowed_*_paths` cleared (matching the `project` decision below —
the session arrives unscoped), `agent_name` set to the target-resolved agent —
while the **conversation payload travels byte-exact**. That distinction is
forced, not stylistic: thinking blocks inside `conversation_metadata` carry a
provider `signature` over their own content, which is validated when the
conversation is replayed, so rewriting any covered byte makes the peer's *next
turn* fail — long after the import reported success. An earlier revision scrubbed
Layer B on both boundaries and, measured against one developer machine's 704 real
sessions, altered a signature in **41%** of them. Redacting this artifact and
transplanting it cannot both hold; what bounds the exposure is the destination
(the operator's own peer, over a tunnel they authenticated, stored `0600`), not a
scrub of the payload. **Layer A keeps its redaction** — that text is rendered and
re-read as context. Inbound Layer B is validated structurally (parse-only, never
rewritten) and refused whole if any record fails to parse. Materialisation is
**best-effort**: if it fails, the import still succeeds as the transcript-only
copy rather than failing an already-persisted session.

Sub-agent conversations deliberately do **not** travel. Their results were
already injected into the parent conversation, so they are inside Layer B
already; only `spawn_continue` against one specific sub-agent is lost on the
peer.

### 14.2 Copy, never move

Import **always allocates a new slot key** and never mutates or deletes an
existing session, on either side. Consequences worth stating:

- the source tab is untouched, so a failed transfer costs nothing;
- a repeat click sends a second copy rather than erroring, so the action needs
  no confirm step and no idempotency key;
- there is no "move" verb and nothing in this feature can destroy a
  conversation.

### 14.3 What travels, and what deliberately does not

| Field | Travels? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| transcript (`user` / `assistant` turns) | yes | Layer A — the portable display copy. Tool and system frames are dropped from it: they reference local tool state. |
| **`layer_b`** (kiro-cli context: envelope + events) | **yes (v2)** | Layer B — the real context window, so the session RESUMES rather than replaying a lossy ~8K prefix. Only host-naming fields are rewritten on arrival (fresh `sid`, cleared `cwd`/`allowed_*_paths`, target agent); the conversation payload travels **byte-exact and unredacted**, because its thinking-block signatures are validated on replay. Optional, and best-effort on import. |
| sub-agent conversations | no | Their results are already inside Layer B as injected context. Only `spawn_continue` on one specific sub-agent is lost. |
| memory (preferences, semantic KV, lessons) | no | A workspace's memory is a per-instance scope, and copying it across hosts is the risky, hard-to-undo part of a transfer. The peer keeps its own. |
| `title` | yes | Prefixed `⇄ ` and suffixed `(from <origin>)` on arrival, so a transferred tab is never mistaken for a locally-born one. The prefix is stripped before re-bundling so a session bounced back and forth does not accumulate one prefix per hop. |
| `agent` | hint only | Applied only if the target has an agent by that name, else dropped. An agent template is a local object; carrying the name blindly would leave the slot pointing at nothing. |
| **`project`** | **no** | The headline decision. The source's checkout path almost never exists on the target (a Mac worktree path on a Linux dev desk), and a slot pointing at a missing directory scopes file search and steering to nothing. The session arrives **unscoped** and the user re-picks a project. |
| `model` | no | Accounts differ in entitlement, so an id the source is served can fail at runtime on the target. The target resolves its own default (AGENTS.md § Model selection). |
| `workspace` | no | Workspaces are per-instance memory scopes; a matching name still means a different memory. |
| `folder_id`, `tags`, `pinned`, `artifact`, `app`, `linked_session_key`, `forked_from` | no | Local-graph references that would dangle. |

`bundle_version` is refused when **outside the supported set** (`{1, 2}`) rather
than best-effort parsed: the two ends are independently-updated installs, and a
silently misread field would land as corrupted conversation. Accepting both
versions is what lets a v2 instance still receive a copy from a v1 one.

### 14.4 API

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/instances/{id}/send-session` | Sending side. Body `{"slot": "<local slot key>"}`. Bundles the local session and delivers it over that instance's open tunnel. |
| `POST /api/chat/slots/import` | Receiving side. Accepts a bundle and materialises a new slot. |

`send-session` goes through the same `_guard()` as every other route in §6
(owner-only, never Slack, feature-gated, SEL-audited as
`instances_send_session`). It returns `{ok, instance, remote_key, messages}`.

Status codes: `404` unknown instance or unknown local slot, `400` a
non-persistent source session or a malformed body, `503` the manager is not
running or the source could not be persisted first, `502` the peer refused or
was unreachable (the peer's own `code` is forwarded).

**`send-session` is NOT a third token-crossing route.** §6's invariant holds:
`connect` and `refresh-token` remain the only two routes whose response carries a
minted token. The transfer needs the credential but the browser does not, so the
request is issued **inside `SshTunnelManager.send_session_bundle`** — the token
never leaves the manager, is sent as a cookie (so it cannot land in the peer's
access log), and is never logged. Any audit of where tokens leave the gateway
still finds exactly two routes.

### 14.5 Trust model for an inbound session

An imported transcript is untrusted input that later becomes context an agent
re-reads, so:

- reaching `/api/chat/slots/import` requires a valid dashboard credential, which
  in practice means a token this hub minted on that host — a peer cannot push a
  session into an instance it has no credential for;
- bundles are size-bounded before anything is written (5,000 messages, 1 MB per
  message, 20 MB of content total) and every message's role is checked against
  `user`/`assistant`;
- assistant content is credential- and exfiltration-redacted on the way in,
  matching the fork path. User turns are left verbatim: redacting what the human
  typed would corrupt their own words;
- **import does not drive a turn.** The session lands as a tab and waits for the
  user to type. This is the feature's main security advantage over an
  agent-facing "send a message to a peer" tool: no inbound text can make a
  remote agent act.

### 14.6 Direction and topology

The submenu on a given dashboard lists **that** gateway's registry, so a push
runs hub → peer. Because each remote dashboard is embedded as an iframe (§3), a
"send" driven from inside a remote pane would need that remote to reach back to
the hub — usually impossible (a dev desk cannot SSH to a laptop). Sending in the
other direction is therefore done by registering the peers you want on each host
that should originate a transfer, and a hub-initiated **pull** (read a peer's
session over the same forward) is the natural follow-on that would make
remote → hub and remote → remote work without any reverse reachability.

## 15. Federated session search (search every connected instance at once)

`GET /api/instances/search-sessions` answers one query with sessions from the
local gateway **and** every instance whose tunnel is currently `CONNECTED`. The
dashboard's two search surfaces switch to it automatically whenever at least one
warm connection exists (the ⌘K palette's Sessions tab and the sidebar's Older
Sessions search); with no warm instance they keep calling the plain local
`/api/sessions/search`, so a peerless install never pays the detour.

### 15.1 It is the hub-initiated pull §14.6 anticipated

The search reuses the transfer's transport shape exactly: the hub GETs a peer's
own `/api/sessions/search` **over the already-open forward** — no SSH spawn, no
new port, no reverse reachability. `SshTunnelManager.search_sessions_remote`
follows `send_session_bundle`'s credential rules to the letter: **the token
never leaves the manager** (§6's invariant holds — `connect` and `refresh-token`
remain the only routes whose response carries one), it travels as the
port-scoped cookie so it cannot land in the peer's access log, and a `401/403`
gets exactly one transparent re-mint retry, because a retained credential can go
stale while the tunnel stays `CONNECTED`.

Each peer request runs under `DEFAULT_SEARCH_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECS` (6s) — sized
between the token probe (2s, a bare ping, which would produce false
"unreachable" verdicts on a loaded peer doing real scan work) and the transfer
budget (30s, which would let one dead tunnel stall a keystroke-driven search).
Peers are fanned out concurrently, so the slowest peer bounds the whole reply.

### 15.2 Merging without a cross-instance score

The aggregator **rank-interleaves**: position *k* of the reply cycles through
each source's *k*-th best hit, local source first. Raw scores are never compared
across gateways — each instance may run a different ranking version (a newer hub
searching an older peer, or vice versa), so a numeric merge would silently
prefer whichever version inflates its scores. Interleaving needs no score wire
format, keeps every source represented in the top rows, and preserves each
source's own internal order.

An unreachable or refusing peer never fails the request: it is reported in the
reply's `unreachable` array as `{id, name, code}` so a caller can tell what was
NOT searched instead of having the result set silently narrowed. The shipped
dashboard surfaces log the report (a visible "N instances unreachable" affordance
is a follow-up); only CONNECTED peers are fanned out, so a miss here is a rare
mid-search transient rather than the steady state for a down instance.
Machine-readable codes distinguish a stale credential (`search_unauthorized`)
from a dead tunnel (`search_unreachable`), a peer error (`search_peer_refused`),
and a garbled reply (`search_malformed_reply`); the same codes are recorded in
the SEL audit event for the request, so an operator can audit which peer failed
and why without reproducing the search.

### 15.3 Peer replies are untrusted input

A peer's rows are re-shaped through a strict allowlist before they reach the
browser: only known fields are copied, strings are type-checked, and `title` /
`snippet` are re-run through the local credential + exfiltration redaction — the
peer claims to have redacted, but this hub does not take its word for it. Rows
from a peer additionally carry `instance_id` + `instance_name`; local rows carry
neither, so the reply shape for a hub with no peers degrades to exactly the
local search's own.

The endpoint runs behind the same `_guard()` as every §6 route (owner-only,
never Slack, `instances.enabled`, SEL-audited as `instances_search_sessions`)
and mirrors the local search's input contract (`q` sanitized, capped at 256
chars, min `SEARCH_MIN_CHARS`; `limit` default 50, max 200). The local rows are
also redacted here: the aggregator calls `conversation_log.search_sessions`
directly rather than going through the `/api/sessions/search` handler where the
local redaction normally lives.

### 15.4 What the UI does with a remote row

A remote row's transcript lives on the other gateway, so the local dashboard can
neither resume nor delete it:

- **Activation switches panes.** Both surfaces route through
  `useSelectInstance` (the single owner of switch-to-a-pane semantics, §3), so
  clicking a remote row activates that instance's embedded pane —
  reconnecting it first if needed. Deep-linking to the specific session inside
  the embedded SPA is a follow-up: the iframe protocol has no open-session
  message yet.
- **The local delete action is hidden** on remote rows. `deleteHistorySession`
  targets the LOCAL session file; with colliding keys across gateways it would
  delete a same-keyed, unrelated local conversation.
- **⌘Enter (open in local split grid) is inert** for remote rows in the
  palette — bound to an explicit no-op, because an absent handler makes the
  palette's Enter dispatch fall back to plain activation and the chord would
  silently switch panes.
- Remote rows are badged with the instance's **raw name** (never translated —
  it is the user's own label, which also keeps the change i18n-neutral), and
  result ids are namespaced by instance so two gateways' same-keyed sessions
  cannot collide in the palette's keyed list. Snippet-highlight offsets are
  shifted by the prefix length so remote rows highlight the same match a local
  row would.
- Any federated-endpoint failure in the UI — including the `403` when the
  instances feature is off — falls back to the plain local search, which is
  always the floor.
