## Browser Module

Website browsing through `playwright-cli`, the Playwright agent CLI. An agent
drives a browser by running shell commands; Kiro Crew owns the install flow, the
snapshot directory, and the dashboard surface that displays and hands over a live
session.

### Architecture

The browser is a **shell capability, not a tool namespace.** Each browser action
is one `playwright-cli` invocation on the agent's ordinary command path, so there
is no MCP server to register, no tool schemas re-sent per request, and no
per-message browse marker. The agent decides per task whether a browser is
warranted or whether `web_fetch` answers the question.

```
agent turn ──shell──▶ playwright-cli <verb> …
                          │
                          ├─▶ stdout: page URL, page title, path to a snapshot YAML
                          └─▶ disk:   .../page-<timestamp>.yml   (the accessibility tree)

agent reads the YAML with its own file tools ONLY when it needs the tree
```

**The stdout line is the contract.** Every command prints the resulting page URL,
the page title, and a filesystem path to a snapshot YAML. Roughly 250 characters
of stdout carry a complete action result, and the accessibility tree stays on
disk until the agent decides it needs it. This is why no compression layer
exists: a wrapper that read the YAML and summarized it would put the tree back
into the model context, which is the cost the on-disk handoff removes.

**The path printed on stdout is authoritative.** The agent uses the exact path it
was given rather than deriving one, because the snapshot directory is owned by the
gateway (see [Snapshot retention](#snapshot-retention)) and is not the agent's
working directory.

**Element refs are per-snapshot.** A ref such as `[ref=e5]` identifies an element
within the snapshot that produced it, and any page change invalidates it. The
invariant an agent must hold is therefore: after a navigation, a click that
changes the page, or a reload, take a fresh `snapshot` and address elements from
that one. A ref reused across a page change either misses or hits the wrong
element, and the failure is silent in the second case, which is why the rule is
stated as re-snapshot rather than as retry-on-error.

**Sessions are named.** `-s=<name>` selects a session, so several independent
browsing contexts coexist under one CLI install and one agent can keep a
logged-in context separate from a throwaway one.

### Capability model

**Presence of `playwright-cli` on PATH is the capability.** The binary absent
means the capability does not exist; installing it is the act that grants it.
There is no toggle, no flag file, and no per-session gesture, because none of
those could be enforced: the CLI documents that all of its capabilities are
always available with no gating, and a binary on PATH is reachable from any shell
turn, so no subset of browsing can be granted or withheld once it is installed.

An install Kiro Crew performs is consent by construction, since the operator
asked for it. An operator's existing working install is also treated as consent,
so an operator who already browses is never silently disarmed.

#### Accepted risk

Presence-as-consent has one hole, accepted deliberately and recorded here so it
is discoverable without reading code.

An operator who installed `playwright-cli` for their own unrelated work has
granted nothing, yet the capability is armed on that host. The exposure is
concrete: `attach --extension` connects to the operator's own running Chrome,
which carries their live logged-in sessions, so an agent turn can drive a browser
holding those sessions without the operator having said yes to that.

It cannot be narrowed after the fact. The CLI offers no capability gating to
subset, and PATH reachability means the restriction cannot be expressed in a tool
surface either. Two mitigations apply, neither of which reintroduces a gate:

- The consent model is stated in the install guide and in the Settings surface,
  so it is documented rather than discovered.
- Browser use is visible after the fact. The dashboard panel showing a live
  session is itself the disclosure.

### Install flow

Global install only. `npx` re-resolves the package through the npm registry on
every invocation, which makes browsing depend on registry auth at run time: an
expired token takes the capability down mid-session. A global binary resolves
once, at install, so registry auth applies at install time only.

1. Detect `playwright-cli` on PATH and Node.js 20 or newer.
2. Install when absent: `npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest`.
3. `playwright-cli install-browser` for the browser binary. The CLI downloads one
   on first use regardless, so the explicit step exists to give the operator a
   progress surface and a visible failure rather than a stall inside the first
   browse. `--with-deps` is appended only on an apt host, and a refusal there is
   retried without it — see [OS dependencies](#os-dependencies).
4. `playwright-cli install --skills agents --global` so the command reference is
   discoverable from the skill file rather than occupying the system prompt.
   `--skills` accepts `claude` (default) or `agents`; `--global` targets the home
   directory instead of the workspace.
5. Record that the install happened.

### Command surface

The full reference lives in the skill the CLI installs in step 4, which is why the
system prompt states only the loop and the ref rule. The verbs:

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle | `open [url]`, `goto`, `close`, `attach --extension` |
| Pointer and form | `click <ref>`, `dblclick`, `fill <ref> <text>`, `type <text>`, `select`, `check`, `uncheck`, `hover`, `drag`, `upload` |
| Read | `snapshot`, `screenshot [ref]`, `pdf`, `eval`, `console`, `network` |
| Navigation | `go-back`, `go-forward`, `reload`, `press <key>`, `resize` |
| Dialogs | `dialog-accept`, `dialog-dismiss` |
| Tabs | `tab-list`, `tab-new`, `tab-select`, `tab-close` |
| State | `state-save [file]`, `state-load <file>`, `cookie-list`/`get`/`set`/`delete`/`clear`, `localstorage-*`, `sessionstorage-*` |
| Capture and scripting | `route`, `run-code`, `tracing-start`/`stop`, `video-start`/`stop` |
| Host | `show`, `install --skills`, `install-browser`, `config-print` |

Sessions are selected with `-s=<name>` on any command.

### Auth

Two paths, chosen by whose browser holds the session.

**Saved state.** `state-save [file]` writes the current context's cookies and
storage to a file, and `state-load <file>` restores it into a session. A logged-in
context is therefore reusable across sessions and across gateway restarts without
re-authenticating. `cookie-list`/`get`/`set`/`delete`/`clear` and the
`localstorage-*` / `sessionstorage-*` families operate on individual entries when
a whole-state round trip is heavier than the task needs.

**Attach.** `attach --extension` connects to the operator's own running Chrome,
which already holds their logins, so no state file is involved. This is the
stronger capability of the two: the sessions are the operator's real ones, which
is what the [accepted risk](#accepted-risk) above is about.

State files hold live session credentials and are written with owner-only
permissions.

**The attach token.** `attach --extension` works without one: the extension
answers a tokenless handshake by asking the human to approve the connection in the
browser. Setting `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN` removes that one click and
nothing else, so it is opt-in and absent by default. `browser_cli/token.py` stores
it owner-only behind `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` — the agent inherits it through
the environment and can never open the file — and no status surface returns the
value, only whether one exists.

The extension presents the token as a shell assignment, so the settings field
accepts either form and stores the same token:

```
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN=<value>
<value>
```

`normalize_paste` strips the prefix only when the text left of the **first** `=`
is exactly the variable name. That condition is a safety property rather than a
nicety: these tokens are base64url and can legitimately contain `=`, so a looser
rule would corrupt a bare token. `export`/`set` keywords and a matched pair of
surrounding quotes are removed for the same reason. Normalization also runs on
read, so a stored value holding the whole assignment repairs itself instead of
reporting "stored" while the extension keeps prompting.

### Snapshot retention

The CLI writes one timestamped YAML per command and documents no pruning, so the
directory grows without bound.

**The gateway service prunes it on a schedule.** Retention belongs to a
long-lived component rather than to the agent for two reasons: the agent has no
reason to know the policy, and a per-command prune would race the daemon.
Snapshots are throwaway state, so retention is by age and count. The service
never deletes a file the current session still refers to, because the path on
stdout is the agent's only handle to the tree.

This is also why the snapshot directory is at a fixed path the service owns
rather than relative to whatever working directory an agent happened to have.

### Dashboard integration

`playwright-cli show --port <n> --host 127.0.0.1` serves the CLI's own dashboard
over loopback HTTP, and the panel embeds that in an iframe. The served dashboard
provides the session grid with live screencast, a session detail view with tab bar
and navigation controls, and full remote mouse and keyboard input, so a human can
take over a session directly: this is the path for a CAPTCHA or a 2FA prompt that
an agent cannot and should not complete. Escape releases input capture.

Three properties of the server must be honoured, because each failure mode
presents as a broken panel rather than as a misconfiguration:

1. **Bind `--host 127.0.0.1` explicitly.** The default listener is IPv6-only, and
   an iframe pointed at `127.0.0.1` gets a connection failure against it.
2. **Health-check for any response, not for 200.** The root path answers 302.
3. **Treat `show` as a supervised child process.** It blocks, so it needs an
   owned lifecycle rather than a fire-and-forget call. `show --kill` stops the
   daemon.

**Never pass `--host 0.0.0.0`.** The served dashboard carries full remote input on
a browser that may hold the operator's sessions, so binding it off loopback
exposes an interactive takeover surface to the network.

### Security

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Capability grant | Presence of `playwright-cli` on PATH; see [Capability model](#capability-model) for what this does and does not cover |
| Dashboard exposure | `show` is bound to `127.0.0.1`; `0.0.0.0` is never passed, because the served view carries remote input |
| Saved state files | Owner-only permissions; they hold live session credentials |
| Page content | Treated as untrusted input. A URL, instruction, or form target read off a page never decides the next navigation |
| Attach mode | Operates the operator's real logged-in browser, so it is the strongest form of the capability and the reason the accepted risk is recorded |
| Approval | Page-scoped verbs run without a prompt; verbs that reach the local machine do not. Matched on the real command from `tool_input`, never the model-authored title. Verb AND flag allowlists, so both `eval` and `screenshot --filename=<path>` keep interactive approval. Logged as `reason: "browser_cli"` |

### Platform notes

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 20 or newer |
| Install | `npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest` |
| Browser binary | `install-browser`; `--with-deps` on an apt host only |
| Attach | Chromium-family only, since Playwright ships an attach extension for that family alone |

### OS dependencies

Playwright's `--with-deps` implementation is **apt-only**. On a distribution it
does not recognize it does not decline — it selects its nearest Ubuntu package
set and runs `apt-get` as root anyway. On an rpm host that is wrong twice: the
package names do not exist, and the command needs a privilege a managed
workstation withholds. Because the flag and the browser download are one CLI
invocation, that refusal also took the download down, which is what made a
missing OS library present as a sudo policy error quoting a 60-package `apt-get`
line the user never typed.

`browser_cli/os_deps.py` resolves the host family from `/etc/os-release`
(`ID` plus `ID_LIKE`, so derivatives resolve through their base) and the browser
step adapts:

| Family | `--with-deps` | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| debian / ubuntu | passed | retried without the flag, so the download still lands |
| rpm (rhel, fedora, centos, amzn, rocky, alma, suse) | never passed | failure detail carries a `sudo dnf install` line naming the rpm packages |
| unrecognized Linux | never passed | no remedy offered — a guessed package manager fails on its own first argument and reads as the product being broken |
| macOS / Windows | not applicable | the browser download alone is sufficient |

The remedy is a command for a human to run, appended to the failing step's
`stderr` (which the settings panel already renders verbatim) rather than a new UI
state. Nothing in this path elevates or runs a package manager. The rpm list
covers Chromium alone: it is the engine `attach` supports and the one `browser_ok`
gates on, so it is what "browsing works" means.

**A zero exit is not a verdict.** MEASURED on Amazon Linux 2023: with libraries
missing, `install-browser` prints

```
Playwright Host validation warning:
║ Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers. ║
```

and **exits 0**, leaving the browser directories in the cache. Playwright
classifies it as a warning. Reading the exit code alone therefore reports a
browser that cannot launch as installed — the panel goes green, `browser_ok`
turns true because the build is genuinely on disk, and the real error arrives at
the user's first browse as an opaque stack trace. Every browser step is judged on
its output as well as its exit code (`os_deps.host_deps_unsatisfied`, matched
against the header and the message body so a reworded box still trips one), and a
match fails the step and carries the remedy.

`browser_ok` keeps meaning "a build is downloaded", which stays literally true on
such a host; the install error is what carries the truth that it cannot run.
Making `browser_ok` mean "and it can launch" would need a validation probe on
every settings poll.

### Standalone enterprise installer

`playwright-cli.sh` (macOS/Linux) and `playwright-cli.ps1` (Windows) install the
same `@playwright/cli` package as the install flow above, for the case that flow
cannot handle: a machine where `npm install -g` does not work. They are run by a
human at a shell, not by the gateway, and nothing in the product invokes them.

They exist because step 2 of the install flow assumes two things an enterprise
laptop often lacks — a Node toolchain of a recent enough major, and a default
registry that answers without a login. When either is missing, a bare
`npm install -g` fails with npm's own output, which does not distinguish "your
token expired" from "the registry is firewalled" from "this mirror does not carry
the package", and those three have mutually exclusive remedies. The scripts remove
both assumptions without introducing a private artifact channel: there is no Kiro
Crew-hosted Playwright build to keep in sync or to trust.

**Node is bootstrapped, not required.** A Node already on PATH is reused when its
major is at least the floor the install flow above requires, as is one recorded by
`ensure-node.sh` in `<data home>/node-bin-dir` — these installers *read* that
marker but never write it, so the sharing is one-directional: a Node they
bootstrap stays private to them, and `ensure-node.sh` still downloads its own.
That is deliberate, because `env.py` hands the marked interpreter to the gateway,
whose floor is higher again.

A reused Node is only reused if `npm` is actually beside it. On Debian and Ubuntu
`nodejs` and `npm` are separate packages, so `apt install nodejs` alone leaves a
perfectly good Node with no npm — and telling that user to install npm would hand
back the one prerequisite these installers exist to remove. Such a Node is
abandoned and a private one bootstrapped instead, because the release tarball
bundles npm. Missing npm in a tree the installer itself unpacked is a different
thing entirely — a truncated archive — and aborts rather than retrying.

Otherwise the release build for the detected platform is downloaded and its
SHA-256 checked against that release's `SHASUMS256.txt` **before it is
executed**; a mismatch, or an artifact the manifest does not list at all, aborts
the install. Selection is libc-aware because an official tarball is not portable:
musl hosts (Alpine) get the unofficial-builds variant, and so do pre-2.28-glibc
hosts (RHEL 7-era) **on x64 only**, which is the only architecture that variant
is published for. The manifest is fetched over the same channel as the artifact
and is not itself signed — identical to `ensure-node.sh`, so this is corruption
detection plus transport trust, not an independent trust root like the signed
manifest `cli.sh` verifies.

**The install is unprivileged and self-contained**, which is where it diverges
from the install flow above: `npm install --global` is run with
`npm_config_prefix` pointed at `<data home>/playwright-cli`, so nothing is written
outside the user's home and sudo is never involved. The generated entry point is a
**wrapper script, not a symlink**: npm's own shim starts `#!/usr/bin/env node`,
which resolves against the *caller's* PATH, so a user whose Node the installer had
to bootstrap would get `node: not found` from a tool that installed perfectly. The
wrapper pins the exact interpreter that was verified, and every path interpolated
into it is escaped, because a generated script treats its inputs as code.

**The public registry is pinned.** An ambient `.npmrc` that redirects the default
registry at a private mirror makes a *public* package 401 the moment that mirror's
token expires. `--registry` re-points it for the opposite case (public registry
firewalled, mirror reachable), and `--isolated-npmrc` ignores the ambient config
entirely. A registry URL carrying a credential — in userinfo or in a query
parameter — is redacted everywhere the scripts print it, and the log is created
owner-only, because npm writes that URL into its own output.

**A credential may not be passed as a flag.** `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is
world-readable, so `--registry https://user:token@host/` publishes the token to
every account on the machine for as long as the install runs, and leaves it in shell
history besides — neither of which redaction can reach, since redaction covers only
what the scripts print. The credential travels in the environment instead
(`KIROCREW_NPM_REGISTRY`, `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`), where `/proc/<pid>/environ` is
readable only by its owner, or through `npm login`. The refusal keys on PROVENANCE
rather than content: the resolved registry value also holds an env-supplied
credential, and refusing that would break the escape the error message recommends.

**Enterprise failures are classified, not passed through.** npm's output is kept
at `<prefix>/playwright-cli-install.log` — namespaced because a caller-supplied
prefix could otherwise make that a generic name the installer truncates — and matched against the failures a corporate network
actually produces. The browser binary is fetched during the install rather than
left to first use, for the same reason: it comes from the Playwright CDN and not
the npm registry, so a network that permits one may block the other, and doing it
here turns that into exit 16 with a mirror remedy instead of a stall inside the
user's first browse. `--with-deps` is deliberately not passed — it installs OS
packages through the system package manager, and this installer never elevates.
The full exit-code table is in `--help`; the codes that carry a diagnosis are 13
(registry rejected auth), 14 (registry unreachable), 15 (package or version
absent) and 16 (browser download blocked).
