# Remote Hosts and Mobile Access

Run Kiro Crew on an always-on host (a VPS, a cloud VM, a Linux desktop, a spare
box) so the chat bot, cron jobs, and task runner keep working while your laptop
sleeps. Then reach the dashboard from wherever you are: an SSH tunnel for a
laptop, a named HTTPS tunnel for a phone.

Four parts, in the order you will need them:

1. [Run 24/7 on a remote host](#1-run-247-on-a-remote-host): host setup and install
2. [Reach it from a laptop or phone](#2-reach-it-from-a-laptop-or-phone): SSH
   tunnels, HTTPS tunnels, session lifetimes, installing as an app
3. [Keep it alive as a service](#3-keep-it-alive-as-a-service): systemd /
   launchd, plus the awkward-host recipe
4. [Troubleshooting](#4-troubleshooting)

## 1. Run 24/7 on a remote host

### Host requirements

- **OS**: any modern Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora,
  CentOS Stream / RHEL 8+, CentOS 7, Amazon Linux 2 / 2023). macOS works too,
  with launchd instead of systemd.
- **Python**: 3.10 or newer (`setup.cfg` sets `python_requires = >=3.10`).
- **Node.js**: needed to build the dashboard bundle. `website/package.json`
  declares `"node": "20 || >=22"`; `kirocrew doctor` warns below Node 16.
- **RAM**: there is no single published floor, because the footprint scales with
  concurrent sessions, spawned subagents, and MCP servers. Two figures from the
  code give you the shape of it: `acp/runtime.py` recycles a long-lived
  multiplexed backend once it passes 500 MiB RSS
  (`_DEFAULT_MAX_RSS_MB = 500.0`), and the embedding model is loaded in-process
  from a ~610MB GGUF file. Measure your own steady state, then leave headroom:
  MCP cold starts and heavy tool calls spike well above it.
- **CPU**: a couple of vCPUs is fine for a single user; extra cores help with
  CPU-intensive tool calls and parallel subagent execution.
- **Architecture**: x86_64 or arm64.

### Install the basics

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu (python3-venv is a separate package here)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git tmux python3 python3-pip python3-venv

# Fedora / CentOS Stream / RHEL 8+ / Amazon Linux 2023 (python3 may be 3.9;
# python3.11 gives the 3.10+ the backend needs)
sudo dnf install -y git tmux python3.11 python3.11-pip

# CentOS 7 / RHEL 7 (yum; base repos ship only Python 3.6, which is too old —
# install a newer interpreter yourself first, e.g. mise; see below)
sudo yum install -y git tmux
curl https://mise.run | sh && mise use -g python@3.12
```

The `curl … | sh` installer performs this distro Python bootstrap for you. On
CentOS 7 and older Ubuntu, where no base-repo package supplies Python 3.10+, it
uses an already-installed [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) if you have one and
otherwise stops with instructions — the signed installer does not pipe an
unsigned script into a shell, so install mise yourself first
(`curl https://mise.run | sh`) if you want that path. Install Node.js from your
distro, [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), or a
version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). `tmux` is handy
for a first smoke test before you install the service.

Set your git identity if you plan to let the agent work on repos on this host:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

### Install the agent backend

Kiro Crew drives the `kiro-cli` agent over ACP, and it is the only provider
(`agent.provider = acp`). Install `kiro-cli` per its own docs, put it on your
`PATH`, and log in:

```bash
kiro-cli login
```

The credentials Kiro Crew itself reads from `~/.kiro/crew/.env` are chat-platform
and owner-identity credentials (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`,
`KIROCREW_OWNER_ID`, and the equivalents for Discord / Telegram / Teams / WeCom
/ Webex). There is no model API key to configure: `kiro-cli` owns the model
credential, and `kiro-cli login` is where it is set.

### Install Kiro Crew

Same two steps as a local machine (Python backend plus the React dashboard
bundle). See the [install guide](install.md) for the full walkthrough:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew.git
cd KiroCrew

# Build the frontend bundle and stage it into the package
cd website && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cp -R website/dist src/kiro_crew/static/dist

# Install the backend (ships the bundled dashboard)
pip install .

# Configure
kirocrew setup
kirocrew doctor            # verify everything, including kiro-cli and Node
```

`kirocrew setup` writes the resolved project directory to
`~/.kiro/crew/project_dir` so the CLI works from any working directory.

Embeddings need no setup step at all: they are always on and run in-process from
a bundled llama-cpp-python, and the model file downloads in the background on
first gateway start. There is no separate embedding service to install.

### Smoke test in tmux

Before you commit to a service unit, confirm the gateway actually boots:

```bash
tmux new -s kirocrew
kirocrew gateway
# Ctrl+B, D to detach; reattach with: tmux attach -t kirocrew
```

tmux survives an SSH disconnect but does **not** auto-restart on crash or
auto-start on reboot. Move to [a real service](#3-keep-it-alive-as-a-service)
once the smoke test passes, and **kill the tmux session first**: only one
gateway can own the dashboard port, which defaults to `5476`
(`config/loader.py` `_DEFAULT_PORT`, overridable with the `KIROCREW_PORT`
environment variable). Two gateways on one port means the second one fails to
bind.

```bash
tmux kill-session -t kirocrew
```

### Move your state to the new host

A fresh install starts with no memories, preferences, lessons, or agent config.
`scripts/sync-to-remote.sh` copies them from your local machine. Run it **from
the local machine**:

```bash
scripts/sync-to-remote.sh user@your-host.example.com

# Non-default dashboard port on the remote (multi-host setups)
scripts/sync-to-remote.sh user@your-host.example.com 7779

# Preview without transferring
scripts/sync-to-remote.sh --dry-run

scripts/sync-to-remote.sh --help
```

It is one-way (local overwrites remote). It takes an atomic SQLite `.backup` of
`memory.db` rather than copying a live WAL, which would land a torn database;
patches the remote `config.json` to `dashboard.url = http://localhost:<port>`
with `auto_open_browser` off (a headless host has no browser to open); and syncs
`sessions/` so your chat history shows up on the remote dashboard. `--dry-run`
prints every transfer without performing it. Set `DEFAULT_HOST` at the top of the
script if you do not want to pass the target every time.

What matters, and where it lives:

| Category | Path | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Structured memory | `~/.kiro/crew/workspace/memory/` | `preferences.md`, `projects.md`, daily `history/` |
| Vector + FTS databases | `~/.kiro/crew/memory.db`, `memory_index.db` | Semantic/episodic memory (`vector_memory.py`) and the FTS5 index (`memory.py`) |
| Lessons | `~/.kiro/crew/memory.db`, falling back to `lessons.jsonl` | See the note below |
| Config | `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` | Chat-platform tokens, model prefs, dashboard settings |
| Skills | `~/.kiro/crew/skills/` | Custom skill definitions |
| Webhook hooks | `~/.kiro/crew/hooks.json` | Script-hook definitions (`hooks.py` `ScriptHookStore`) |
| Cron jobs | `~/.kiro/crew/crons.json` | Scheduled recurring jobs (`cron.py`) |

> **Where lessons actually live.** Both stores exist and the vector store wins
> when it holds anything. `learn.py` appends to `<config_dir>/lessons.jsonl`,
> but `vector_memory.write_lesson()` stores lessons as semantic entries in
> `memory.db`, and `ContextBuilder` reads `get_lessons_context()` from the vector
> store first, only falling back to the JSONL when that comes back empty. So
> sync **both**: `memory.db` is authoritative on any host that has ever written
> a lesson natively, and the JSONL still carries lessons written before that.

What NOT to carry over:

- `~/.kiro/crew/kiro_pids.txt`, `kiro_session_pids.txt`, and the
  `session_pid_<pid>.txt` / `.sig` sidecars: live PID tracking
  (`session_pid.py`), meaningless on another host and actively misleading if
  copied.
- `~/.kiro/crew/security_events.jsonl`: the tamper-evident SEL audit chain
  (`sel.py`); it belongs to the host that wrote it.
- `~/.kiro/crew/.env`, `.local_secret`, `sel_hmac.key`: secrets. Re-enter the
  `.env` credentials with `kirocrew setup`; the other two are regenerated.

Keeping two hosts loosely in sync afterwards is just rsync (replace the SSH
target):

```bash
alias mc-sync='rsync -avz ~/.kiro/crew/workspace/memory/ user@your-host.example.com:~/.kiro/crew/workspace/memory/ \
  && rsync -avz ~/.kiro/crew/memory.db ~/.kiro/crew/memory_index.db user@your-host.example.com:~/.kiro/crew/'
```

Run it only while both gateways are stopped, or you will copy a live WAL-mode
database out from under a writer.

---

## 2. Reach it from a laptop or phone

The gateway binds `127.0.0.1` and stays there. `is_local_only()` in
`dashboard/urls.py` always returns `True` in this build, so **setting
`dashboard.url` does not widen the bind**: it only changes the host used in
generated links and adds that origin to the CSRF/WebSocket allowlist. The one
bind override is `KIROCREW_BIND` (an IP address, validated by
`bind_address_for()`), which exists for containers where published ports map to
a bridge interface; the official Docker image sets it. Both server paths mount
the token-auth middleware unconditionally, so a wider bind never exposes an
unauthenticated surface beyond the three token-free liveness probes
(`/api/health`, `/api/live`, `/api/ready`).

Everything below therefore works by putting something in front of loopback.

### SSH tunnel (laptop)

```bash
ssh -L 5476:localhost:5476 user@your-host.example.com
```

Then open `http://localhost:5476` locally. For a non-default remote port, match
both sides:

```bash
ssh -N  -L 7779:localhost:7779 user@your-host.example.com   # foreground, no shell
ssh -fN -L 7779:localhost:7779 user@your-host.example.com   # background
```

To get the tunnel on every connection, add to your local `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host your-host.example.com
    LocalForward 5476 localhost:5476
```

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (OpenSSH ships with Windows 10+; the config
file is at `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config`).

If your browser reaches the dashboard on a *different* local port than the
remote one (`ssh -L 8777:localhost:5476`), the browser sends Origin
`http://localhost:8777`, which is not in the default allowlist. Opt that port in
with `KIROCREW_ALLOWED_LOOPBACK_PORTS` on the gateway host; the CSRF check
deliberately does not blanket-trust every loopback port, because a malicious
local page on an arbitrary port would otherwise pass it.

### Named HTTPS tunnel (phone)

A phone cannot open an SSH port-forward, so put a tunnel provider in front of
the loopback port and point the bot's links at it. Use a **named** tunnel, not
an ephemeral one: a named tunnel keeps the same URL across restarts, so
`dashboard.url` stays correct and you do not have to re-edit config and restart
the gateway every time the tunnel reconnects. An ephemeral tunnel mints a fresh
random hostname on each start, which silently invalidates both `dashboard.url`
and the origin allowlist derived from it.

With [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/):

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create kirocrew
cloudflared tunnel route dns kirocrew kirocrew.example.com
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5476 run kirocrew
```

With [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) the equivalent is
`ngrok http --domain=kirocrew.example.com 5476`.

**If you use Tailscale, prefer `tailscale serve` over Funnel.** The two are not
the same and the difference is the whole security story:

- [`tailscale serve`](https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve) publishes the
  dashboard **only inside your tailnet** — nothing is reachable from the public
  internet, you get TLS and a stable MagicDNS hostname, and who can reach it is
  governed by your tailnet ACLs. This is the better answer for the phone case:
  ```bash
  tailscale serve --bg --https 443 http://127.0.0.1:5476
  kirocrew config set dashboard.tailscale.enabled true
  kirocrew restart
  ```
  `dashboard.tailscale.enabled` reads your own MagicDNS name from the local
  Tailscale daemon once at startup and trusts `https://<that name>` as an origin,
  so you do **not** have to look the name up and hand-write `dashboard.url`. If
  Tailscale is absent, stopped, or MagicDNS is off it contributes nothing and the
  dashboard starts exactly as before. It does not widen the network bind and does
  not change authentication — every request still needs a dashboard session.
- [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) does the opposite: it
  puts the service **on the public internet**, like cloudflared and ngrok. Use it
  only if you actually want public ingress.

A shared corporate tailnet is not a private network — every member who can reach
the Serve endpoint is inside your trust boundary, so keep the ACL narrow.

For the tunnel providers above (cloudflared / ngrok / Funnel) set the URL in
`~/.kiro/crew/config.json` and restart:

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "url": "https://kirocrew.example.com"
  }
}
```

```bash
kirocrew restart
```

`dashboard.url` does two things: chat-platform links are generated against that
host instead of `localhost`, and its origin is added to the allowed-origin set
so the CSRF check and the WebSocket handshake accept requests arriving through
the tunnel. Keep the tunnel process running (tmux, or the provider's own
service installer such as `cloudflared service install`).

> proxy attaches those.

### Getting a link on your phone

1. In your Kiro Crew DM, send `/kirocrew dashboard` (or `/kirocrew dashboard 6h`).
2. The bot DMs you `https://<tunnel-url>/?token=...`.
3. Tap it. The link exchanges the token for an access cookie **and** a 30-day
   refresh cookie, so this is not a daily ritual — see
   [Session duration](#session-duration).

`kirocrew token` does the same thing from a shell on the gateway host.

### Session duration

Three clocks. The first two are signed into the access token payload
(`dashboard/token_auth.py`), the third into the refresh cookie
(`dashboard/refresh_tokens.py`):

| Clock | Value | What it governs |
|---|---|---|
| Link click window (`exp`) | 5 minutes (`LINK_WINDOW_SECS = 300`) | The presigned URL must be **opened** within this window |
| Access session TTL (`session_exp`) | 1 hour by default, 20 hours maximum (`MAX_SESSION_TTL_SECS = 20 * 3600`) | How long the access cookie the link mints stays valid |
| Refresh TTL | 30 days (`MAX_REFRESH_TTL_SECS = 30 * 86400`) | How long the dashboard can silently mint a new access cookie without a new link |

**You re-run `/kirocrew dashboard` or `kirocrew token` roughly once per 30 _idle_
days — not every 20 hours.** Opening the link sets two cookies, not one: the
access cookie plus an `mc_refresh_<port>` refresh cookie (HttpOnly,
path-restricted to `/api/auth`). The dashboard schedules a
`POST /api/auth/refresh` one hour before the access cookie expires (`LEAD_MS` in
`website/src/hooks/useRefreshScheduler.ts`), which rotates **both** cookies. If
the tab is hidden when that timer fires, the refresh defers until it is visible
again. If the access cookie has already expired by the time you open the
dashboard, `GET /api/auth/me` is denied (403 with `X-Auth-Required: true`) and the
frontend refreshes once and retries before any login UI appears — so a phone left
closed overnight still opens straight into a working session.

Each rotation mints a fresh refresh cookie with a **new** 30-day window, carrying
the same `chain_id` forward, and validation never consults the chain's original
creation time. The 30 days is therefore a **sliding idle window, not a hard
expiry**: open the dashboard at least once a month and you need never mint
another link.

The access-session numbers still govern the initial mint. The chat-command
default is 1 hour (`ttl = 3600` in `slack/events.py` and `slack/handler.py`);
pass a duration to raise it (`/kirocrew dashboard 6h`,
`/kirocrew dashboard 20h`). `parse_duration` accepts `<N>h` or `<N>m` and clamps
to the 20-hour ceiling, so asking for more silently gets you 20 hours rather than
an error. `kirocrew token` defaults straight to `20h`. The 5-minute click window
is not the session length: it only means a link left sitting in a DM overnight is
dead and you need a fresh one.

**When you do need a fresh link.** Three things end a refresh chain:

- **30 days idle** — nothing opened the dashboard inside the window.
- **Signing out in the dashboard** (`POST /api/auth/logout`) — revokes that
  browser's chain and denylists its access cookie. `kirocrew logout` is **not**
  equivalent: it ends access sessions globally but leaves refresh chains live, so
  a browser still holding one mints a fresh access cookie on its next refresh.
- **Reuse detection** — a consumed refresh token replayed outside a 60-second
  same-IP grace window (`REFRESH_GRACE_SECS`) auto-revokes the entire chain
  (RFC 6819 §5.2.2.3). The frontend reports `refresh_chain_revoked` and stops
  scheduling refreshes; the mint screen appears once the remaining access session
  runs out.

Chains persist in `~/.kiro/crew/refresh_chains.json` (mode `0600`), so they
survive a gateway restart. On a gateway old enough to predate the feature,
`GET /api/auth/me` returns 404; the frontend logs once and falls back to the
20-hour URL-mint behaviour.

### Install as an app (PWA)

The dashboard ships a web app manifest
([`website/public/manifest.json`](../../website/public/manifest.json)) and
registers a service worker, so a phone can install it to the home screen and
launch it without browser chrome. Nothing needs enabling.

**HTTPS is what the service worker needs** — the install itself is looser.
Service workers only register in a secure context, so over a plain
`http://<host>:5476` from another device on the LAN you get the manifest but no
service worker. On **iOS Safari** that still installs and still launches
standalone; you only lose the offline shell described below. On **Android
Chrome** the promoted install flow expects a secure origin, so use HTTPS there
rather than relying on whatever manual shortcut path the current version offers.
Any option in [Named HTTPS tunnel (phone)](#named-https-tunnel-phone) provides a
secure context, and loopback counts as one too, which is why it works untunnelled
on the gateway host itself.

**On iOS Safari**, open the dashboard, tap Share → *Add to Home Screen*, then
launch from the new icon. The manifest's `"display": "standalone"` is what drops
Safari's address bar.

**The service worker provides a limited offline shell.**
[`website/public/sw.js`](../../website/public/sw.js) caches exactly `/` and
`/index.html`. For the paths below the worker declines to intercept, handing them
straight to the network; every other same-origin `GET` **is** intercepted,
network-first, but only the shell is ever cached:

| Path | Why the worker declines it |
|---|---|
| `/api`, `/apps/` | Gateway and app-backend responses must never be served stale |
| `/assets/` | Vite content-hashed bundles — HTTP immutable caching already covers them |
| `/vendor/`, `/fonts/`, `/sprites/` | Stable filenames, nothing to bust |
| `/logo.png`, `/static/` | Gateway-served brand assets; caching them strands a broken image across a gateway restart |

So offline you get the shell and its reconnecting state — and only while the
browser's own HTTP cache still holds the hashed `/assets/` bundles, which the
worker never caches. After a build that changes those hashes, the cached shell
references bundle URLs nothing has downloaded yet. Sessions, history, and
notifications are never served from disk.

**Two current limits**, documented here so they read as boundaries rather than
bugs:

- **Notifications need the app open.** The dashboard raises them through the
  foreground `Notification` constructor
  ([`website/src/hooks/useNativeNotification.ts`](../../website/src/hooks/useNativeNotification.ts))
  and there is no Web Push subscription, so nothing arrives while the installed
  app is closed or backgrounded. On iOS that constructor is unavailable inside an
  installed PWA at all — notifications there require
  `ServiceWorkerRegistration.showNotification()`. Tracked in
  [issue #2267](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/2267); the Android
  symptom is [issue #1828](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/1828).
- **Not edge-to-edge.** The shell sets neither `viewport-fit=cover` nor any
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding, so on a notched device the installed app
  renders inside the safe area rather than filling the screen.

Installing changes nothing about authentication: the app carries the same cookies
the browser holds, on the same clocks as [Session duration](#session-duration).

### Persistent SSH tunnel on macOS (LaunchAgent)

A terminal-held tunnel dies with the terminal. A LaunchAgent survives reboots
and reconnects after sleep. A ready-made plist is at
[`assets/com.kirocrew.tunnel.plist`](assets/com.kirocrew.tunnel.plist):

```bash
cp docs/guides/assets/com.kirocrew.tunnel.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
sed -i '' 's|ALIAS@DEV_DESKTOP_HOSTNAME|user@your-host.example.com|g' \
  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kirocrew.tunnel.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kirocrew.tunnel.plist
```

Verify with the token-free liveness probe (`/api/status` needs a token,
`/api/health` does not):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5476/api/health     # {"ok": true, ...}
```

Manage it:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/kirocrew-tunnel.log
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.kirocrew.tunnel                            # restart
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.kirocrew.tunnel                                 # stop
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kirocrew.tunnel.plist  # start
```

The plist sets `ServerAliveInterval=30`, `ServerAliveCountMax=3`,
`ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`, and `KeepAlive`, so macOS restarts the tunnel after
a sleep/wake or network change; reconnect takes roughly 30 seconds. Use SSH
key-based authentication so the reconnect is passwordless.

### Raycast script (macOS, zsh)

Opens the tunnel if needed, mints a token on the remote, and opens the browser.

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh -e
# Required parameters:
# @raycast.schemaVersion 1
# @raycast.title Open KiroCrew
# @raycast.mode compact
# Optional parameters:
# @raycast.packageName KiroCrew Utils
# Documentation:
# @raycast.description Get a token and open the dashboard
REMOTE_HOST="user@your-host.example.com"
REMOTE_CMD='source ~/.zshrc; kirocrew token'
DEBUG_LOG="/tmp/kirocrew_debug.log"

if lsof -i :5476 -sTCP:LISTEN > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Tunnel already open"
else
  ssh -fNT -L 5476:localhost:5476 "${REMOTE_HOST}"
  echo "Tunnel opened"
fi

# `kirocrew token` prints only URL(s) on stdout (failures go to stderr). Keep the
# localhost one: that is what routes through the SSH tunnel opened above.
URL="$(ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 "${REMOTE_HOST}" "${REMOTE_CMD}" 2>"${DEBUG_LOG}" | grep -m1 'localhost:5476')"

if [[ -z "$URL" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: no token URL. Check ${DEBUG_LOG}"
  exit 1
fi

open "$URL"
```

---

## 3. Keep it alive as a service

### The built-in installer

```bash
kirocrew service install
```

On Linux this writes a **system-level** systemd unit at
`/etc/systemd/system/kirocrew.service` and enables it, so the gateway survives
SSH disconnects, restarts on failure, and starts on boot
(`WantedBy=multi-user.target`). On macOS it writes a launchd LaunchAgent at
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.kirocrew.gateway.plist` with `RunAtLoad`,
`KeepAlive=true`, and a finite `ExitTimeOut`, so it starts at login, relaunches
after exit, and force-kills only after the graceful stop deadline. An explicit
`kirocrew stop` unloads the agent so it stays down for the current login session.

```bash
kirocrew service status      # service state
kirocrew logs -f             # tail live logs
kirocrew stop                # stop
kirocrew restart             # restart (service-aware)
kirocrew service uninstall   # remove the unit / plist
```

**Sudo scope on Linux:** the install shells out to `sudo install` (to place the
unit as root-owned `0644`) and `sudo systemctl` (daemon-reload, enable,
restart). No kirocrew, MCP, or LLM code path runs under sudo. Once started the
gateway runs as `User=$USER Group=$(id -gn)`, not root. The unit also caps
crash-looping with `StartLimitBurst=3` / `StartLimitIntervalSec=300` and pins
`LimitNOFILE=65536`, because a stock 1024 FD limit fails the frontend
production build with `EMFILE`.

**Why system-level rather than `systemctl --user`:** older distros (systemd 219
era) have no working per-user manager, and `systemctl --user` there fails with
`Failed to get D-Bus connection`. A system unit behaves the same on every
systemd since 2015.

### Hosts without a working `systemd --user`

If you specifically want a **user** unit and `systemctl --user status` errors
out, the per-user manager is not running. Enable it once (needs sudo), then
install the user unit:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/user@$(id -u).service << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=User Manager for UID %i
After=systemd-user-sessions.service
After=user-runtime-dir@%i.service
Wants=user-runtime-dir@%i.service

[Service]
LimitNOFILE=infinity
LimitNPROC=infinity
User=%i
PAMName=systemd-user
Type=notify
PermissionsStartOnly=true
ExecStartPre=/bin/loginctl enable-linger %i
ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd --user
Slice=user-%i.slice
KillMode=mixed
Delegate=yes
TasksMax=infinity
Restart=always
RestartSec=15

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable user@$(id -u).service
sudo systemctl start user@$(id -u).service
```

`ExecStartPre=/bin/loginctl enable-linger` is the load-bearing line: without
lingering, the user manager (and everything under it) is torn down when your
last login session ends, which defeats the entire point of running 24/7.

Verify with `systemctl --user status`, then install the user unit with the helper
script [`assets/setup.sh`](assets/setup.sh). It resolves the `kirocrew` binary
and the Node version, renders [`assets/kirocrew.service`](assets/kirocrew.service)
into `~/.config/systemd/user/`, and enables it. It reads the template from its
own directory, so run it from there, and it refuses to proceed if a gateway is
already running (that port conflict again):

```bash
cd docs/guides/assets && ./setup.sh
```

Either way, read the rendered `Environment=PATH=` line before you start the
service and drop any entry that does not exist on your host, then add whatever
does: the unit gets exactly this `PATH` and nothing from your shell profile.

Or do it by hand:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp docs/guides/assets/kirocrew.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
sed -i "s|KIROCREW_BIN|$(command -v kirocrew)|g" ~/.config/systemd/user/kirocrew.service
sed -i "s/%u/$(whoami)/g" ~/.config/systemd/user/kirocrew.service
sed -i "s/NVM_NODE_VERSION/$(node --version)/g" ~/.config/systemd/user/kirocrew.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable kirocrew
systemctl --user start kirocrew
```

`systemctl --user status kirocrew` should report `active (running)`.

> **`Failed to get D-Bus connection` while running `systemctl --user`?** Your
> shell has no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, which is how the client finds the per-user bus
> socket. This is normal in a non-login shell, in a `cron` job, and inside an

Manage a user unit:

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Status | `systemctl --user status kirocrew` |
| Restart | `systemctl --user restart kirocrew` |
| Logs | `journalctl --user -u kirocrew -f` |
| Uninstall | `systemctl --user disable --now kirocrew` |

### Hand-rolled system unit

If you want to customize the unit rather than let `kirocrew service install`
generate it:

```bash
KIROCREW_BIN=$(command -v kirocrew 2>/dev/null || echo "$HOME/.local/bin/kirocrew")

sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/kirocrew.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=KiroCrew AI Agent Gateway
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
StartLimitBurst=3
StartLimitIntervalSec=300

[Service]
Type=simple
User=$(whoami)
ExecStart=$KIROCREW_BIN gateway
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
LimitNOFILE=65536
WorkingDirectory=$HOME
Environment=HOME=$HOME
Environment=PATH=$(dirname $KIROCREW_BIN):$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/$(node -v 2>/dev/null || echo v20.0.0)/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now kirocrew
```

Tail it with `sudo journalctl -u kirocrew -f`. Getting `PATH` right matters:
the unit does not inherit your interactive shell's environment, so `kiro-cli`,
`node`, and `npx` must all be reachable from the `PATH` you set here or MCP
servers and tool calls fail with ENOENT.

## 4. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `kirocrew: command not found` after install | Put pip's script dir on `PATH` (often `~/.local/bin`), then `source ~/.bashrc` or re-login |
| Agent backend errors or timeouts | Confirm `kiro-cli` is on `PATH` and logged in (`kiro-cli login`); `kirocrew doctor` reports its status |
| Service will not start | `sudo journalctl -u kirocrew -n 50` (system unit) or `journalctl --user -u kirocrew -n 50` (user unit) |
| Service restart-loops then gives up | `StartLimitBurst=3` within 5 minutes stops the loop on purpose. Read the logs, fix the cause, then `sudo systemctl reset-failed kirocrew` |
| `systemctl --user` says `Failed to get D-Bus connection` | `export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)` |
| Gateway will not bind the port | Something else already owns it, usually a tmux gateway. `tmux kill-session -t kirocrew`, then `ss -ltnp \| grep 5476` |
| SSH tunnel connection refused | Confirm the gateway is running and listening: `ss -ltnp \| grep 5476` on the remote host |
| Dashboard loads over the tunnel but the live view flaps online/offline | The TLS-terminating proxy must forward `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`; without it the auth cookie is set without `Secure` and mobile browsers withhold it from the `wss://` upgrade. Refresh itself keeps working (the refresh cookie is `SameSite=Lax`, so it still rides ordinary HTTPS requests), but both cookies then lack `Secure` and could be sent over plain HTTP — fix the header rather than living with it |
| Chat link still points at `localhost` | Set `dashboard.url` in `config.json` and restart the gateway |
| Link opens to "token expired" | The presigned URL must be opened within 5 minutes. Request a fresh link |
| Session drops sooner than you expect | You should be refreshed silently for 30 sliding days. If you are re-minting every ~20 hours instead, the refresh cookie is not reaching `/api/auth/refresh` — confirm the browser is sending an `mc_refresh_<port>` cookie whose port suffix matches the port the gateway resolved for the request, and check the browser console for `[refresh]` warnings. Raising the initial mint (`/kirocrew dashboard 20h`) only widens the access cookie; it does not repair a broken refresh |
| Phone cannot reach the tunnel URL | Verify the tunnel process is running and connected on the gateway host |
| Settings will not save over the tunnel | By design. Config-write and secret-reveal endpoints require a direct-local request, and forwarding headers mark a tunnelled request as remote. Change these over an SSH session on the host |
| "Embeddings not ready" in the dashboard | The ~610MB model downloads in the background over HTTPS on gateway start. `kirocrew doctor` probes the resolved URL; set `KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_URL` for a mirror. Memory falls back to keyword search until it lands, and the agent keeps working |
