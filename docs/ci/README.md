| [harness-parity-gate.md](harness-parity-gate.md) | The added-line gate keeping the Kiro harness first-class: the six rules, and why it reports rather than enforces whole-tree. |

| [prepare-pr-portability.md](prepare-pr-portability.md) | How the `prepare-pr` skill resolves a per-project profile. |

The local gate you run before committing is in [../../AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md);
