"""Tests for CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT applied uniformly across _run_chat dispatch sites.

Background: the constant was originally introduced as a 600s
recovery-path budget, scoped to a single subagent-injection failure path. It
was later hoisted to a shared constant and added to chat_runner.py's
queue-drain path, but the primary user-typed turn (chat_handlers.py), the
cron injection path (handlers/messaging.py), the Slack/dashboard nudge path
(slack/gateway.py:_handle_nudge), and the cron-script delivery path
(slack/gateway.py:_deliver_script_result) remained unwrapped — depending on
the inner ACP _DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT (7200s) instead.

This module verifies the cap value is correct AND that all eight dispatch
sites in the source tree are wrapped with ``asyncio.wait_for(...,
timeout=CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT)``.

Why source-level checks (not behavioral): a behavioral test that mocks
``_run_chat`` and patches ``CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT`` to a tiny value can prove
``asyncio.wait_for`` raises ``TimeoutError`` — but that's stdlib behavior, not
verification of the application code. To test the wrap behaviorally would
require invoking each real handler entry point with a fully-mocked aiohttp
request, dashboard state, and slot — fragile, coupled to mock setup, and
still indirect. The source-level static checks below directly verify the
property we care about (every ``_run_chat`` dispatch is wrapped) and fail
loudly when a future contributor adds a new bare dispatch site.
