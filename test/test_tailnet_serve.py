"""Publishing the dashboard on a tailnet: a write path, so failures must survive.

The sibling suite (``test_tailnet_origin.py``) pins the opposite property — that
the READ path swallows everything and degrades to "contributes nothing". Here the
weighting is inverted, because a publish that fails silently is the bug:

* :class:`TestFailureReporting` pins that the daemon's own stderr reaches the
  caller **verbatim**, and that the two refusals with different remedies
  (permission vs. daemon down) are told apart. The classifier matches on upstream
  wording we do not own, so the tests assert the raw text is present regardless of
  whether the classification lands.
* :class:`TestGovernance` pins the ASYMMETRY that makes the ceiling coherent:
  publishing is refused when pinned and does not spawn the CLI at all, while
  *withdrawing* is never gated — a fail-closed control that could not un-expose a
  host would fail open in effect.
* :class:`TestArgv` pins the exact argv, because the HTTPS port is what makes the
  derived origin (which carries no port) match, and the upstream target is
  loopback so publishing never widens the gateway's bind.
* :class:`TestPublishedDetection` pins that an unreadable status document reports
  ``None`` rather than ``False``. This code has never seen a real
  ``tailscale serve status --json``, so "we could not tell" has to be
  representable — reporting "not published" for a published node is the
  checked-but-never-ran defect in a new costume.
