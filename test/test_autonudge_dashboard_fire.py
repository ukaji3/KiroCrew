"""Tests for the dashboard auto-nudge fire path.

The defect these pin: the fire path resolved its slot with a bare in-memory
dict lookup and, on a miss, deleted the loop from ``autonudge.json``. A miss is
not evidence of a dead session — the registry is empty for any tab the user has
navigated away from, and empty for EVERY slot immediately after a gateway
restart, because ``AutoNudgeService.start()`` re-arms timers before the
dashboard has restored its slots. So closing a browser tab or restarting the
gateway permanently destroyed a babysit loop, silently abandoning the pull
request it was watching.

The cron origin-injection path already had the correct behaviour (rehydrate from
persisted history, and respect a tab the user explicitly closed); this brings
the nudge path onto the same contract.
