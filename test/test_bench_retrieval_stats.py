"""Retrieval metric maths, the measurability guard, and the A/B statistics.

Split into three parts because they need three different amounts of machinery.
The metric functions are pure and are tested on hand-built ranked lists. The
measurability guard is pure too but reasons over a whole corpus. The end-to-end
section is the only part that needs a real store, and it uses the toy embedder so
it runs in milliseconds with no model and no network.

The two assertions worth the most are in the end-to-end section. First, that an
unscorable query is *skipped* rather than scored zero — the difference between
measuring the memory layer and measuring the dataset's bookkeeping. Second, that
``run_retrieval`` is bit-for-bit reproducible: the entire design rests on
retrieval being deterministic (local embedder, deterministic ranker, no sampling),
because that is what licenses an exact delta from a single pass with no
repetitions and no confidence interval. If that ever stops being true, every
"exact delta" claim in the reports becomes false and nothing else would notice.
