"""Tests for ``atomic_write``'s bytes and owner-only capabilities (issue #1105).

These two gaps are why a set of hand-rolled temp-write-and-rename sites could
not adopt the shared helper, and so silently missed the Windows rename retry:

* binary payloads (a compiled helper binary, an archive) could not pass through
  a ``content: str`` signature at all;
* secret-bearing payloads need an owner-only DACL applied BEFORE the content is
  written, and ``mode=`` cannot deliver that because ``fchmod_safe`` is a
  documented no-op on Windows.

The ordering assertions are the load-bearing ones. A lockdown applied after the
content is written, or a ``fchmod`` that widens the file back to the umask
default afterwards, would both still pass a naive "final mode is 0600" check
while leaving the secret exposed for the duration of the write.
