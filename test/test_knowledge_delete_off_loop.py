"""``delete_items_batch`` must never run on the event loop.

It rebuilds the entire entity graph (``store._load_graph``: clear + two full table
scans) inside its own ``BEGIN``/``COMMIT``, so on a large library it blocks the loop
past the stall watchdog. The watchdog then exits, the supervisor respawns, and the
fresh process runs the same scan -- a crash loop, observed repeatedly against a
2900-document folder source with the frozen stack pinning
``store.delete_items_batch <- ingestion._ingest_file_body <- folder_watcher._do_scan``.

Two tests, deliberately different in kind:

* the AST ratchet pins every call site at once and fails if any future edit calls it
  straight from a coroutine body, including sites this PR has not seen;
* the behavioural test proves the offload is real rather than lexical -- it asserts
  the THREAD the call lands on, so a refactor that keeps ``asyncio.to_thread`` in the
  source but hands it something already-invoked still fails.

    ``run_to_completion`` guarantees the gate FINISHES and then re-raises the
    cancellation, so anything the caller was going to do afterwards is skipped by
    construction -- not merely at risk. The gate commits the delete of the previous
    group, the location claim on the holder's items and the terminal job row, so a
    shutdown landing there used to leave all three durable with no state row naming
    them: the claim cannot be detached (a ``scanning`` row has no ``text_hash``, so
    the detach short-circuits) and the content is orphaned.

    Passing the caller's write in as ``on_duplicate`` puts it inside the same hop.
    Here the awaiting task is cancelled while the gate is in flight; the finalizer
    must still have run.

    The finalizer runs inside the gate's own transaction, not after its commit. That

    state row does not exist yet, so a ``delete_source_cascade`` landing in the gap
    reassigns the surviving item to this source and then has nothing to adopt it
    into -- ``_adopt_reassigned_item`` matches on ``(source_id, hash)``, finds no

    Atomicity is asserted the direct way: make the finalizer raise, and require that
