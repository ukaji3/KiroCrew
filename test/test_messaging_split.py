# --------------------------------------------------------- item 10: the oracle
#
# The exhaustive small-space sweep, and why it exists: whole-line eligibility was
# fixed three times by closing the reported instance — a guard on one arithmetic
# path — and each round found another path to a dirty cut that skipped it. This
# sweep pins the CLASS rather than an instance. At these sizes every seam of the
# grammar is reachable (openers, closers, runs that cross the closer threshold,
# mid-line runs, empty lines, an unterminated last line) crossed with every
# budget where a fence's scaffolding is comparable to the budget itself —
# including the room-of-zero regime, where the ladder used to be skipped whole.
#
# Everything below reads the fence grammar from the CONTRACT, never from
# ``split.py``: no helper of the module is imported here, so a grammar bug in the
# module cannot agree with itself into a pass.
