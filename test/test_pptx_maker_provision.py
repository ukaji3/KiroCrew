"""Tests for engine provisioning (`backend/provision.py`).

Lives in the repo-level ``test/`` tree (not the app's in-package ``tests/``)
because ``setup.cfg`` sets ``testpaths = test transfer`` — a test under
``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/...`` is never collected by CI.

The engine is third-party code fetched at runtime and then BUILT and EXECUTED
(`uv sync` compiles wheels; the app's agents drive the engine), so what decides
which bytes run is the security story of this module. That pin now lives in
``engine_source`` (a sha256 over the received archive) and is tested in
``test_pptx_maker_engine_source.py``; what is pinned HERE is the `uv` resolver,
the sandboxed spawn, and provisioning's failure ladder.

    These four configs pre-authorized ``read`` alongside ``web_fetch`` — the
    exfiltration pair — so URL content that talked the agent into reading a file could
    send it back out with neither call surfacing for approval.

    Removing the key costs nothing functional: the tools stay in ``tools``, so the
    agent can still call them; each call now prompts (or is auto-approved by the
    read-only policy in ``hooks.py``, AFTER the deny and governance checks).
