"""``ensure-python.sh`` must record a real interpreter path, not a symlink.

uv and mise expose the interpreter they manage as a symlink on PATH (typically
``~/.local/bin/python3.13``). python-build-standalone builds — what both of them
install — locate their stdlib relative to the *invoked* path's dirname instead of
following the symlink first, so a venv created from that symlink is written with
``home = ~/.local/bin`` in ``pyvenv.cfg``, looks for the stdlib under
``~/.local/lib/python3.13``, and aborts with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named 'encodings'" — which fails ensurepip and so ``make build``.

``make backend`` feeds the recorded path straight to ``python -m venv``, so
resolving symlinks before recording is what keeps that working.
