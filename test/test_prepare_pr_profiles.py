"""Tests for the prepare-pr project-profile mechanism.

Covers:
  * resolve_profile.py resolution order (config / kirocrew markers /
    auto-detect / generic) and the bundled KiroCrew profile contents.
  * pr_status.py readiness-context override (flag / env / default) and the
    positional-argument stripping that makes it work.

The scripts live under the packaged builtin skill and are NOT importable as a
package, so we load them by path with importlib. Everything here is stdlib and
runs on the full CI matrix (3.10 + 3.12); the TOML path is version-guarded
because tomllib is 3.11+.
