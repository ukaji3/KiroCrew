"""Screenshot capture, persistence and the ring trim (``capture_macos.py``).

Four properties, each with a concrete failure it prevents:

* **The spool lives under ``tempfile.gettempdir()``**, never a hardcoded ``/tmp``
  or a raw ``TMPDIR`` read. Pinned by SOURCE TEXT as well as behaviour — the same
  idiom and the same assertion shape ``test_mcp_playwright_proxy.py`` uses — because
  ``/tmp`` does not exist on Windows and macOS hands a sandboxed process a private
  per-user temp dir a hardcoded path would miss.
* **The directory is ``0o700`` and every file goes through
  ``platform_compat.restrict_to_owner``.** The frames are pixels of the operator's
  own windows; another local account must not be able to list or read them. The
  mode is re-asserted after ``makedirs`` because ``mode=`` is filtered by the umask
  and ``exist_ok=True`` skips it entirely for a directory a laxer earlier build
  created.
* **The spool is ring-trimmed to ``SCREENSHOT_KEEP``.** It is a cache, not an
  archive: a long session must not be able to fill the temp volume.
* **A snapshot containing a secure element produces NO screenshot at all.** THE
  always-on floor. A password field's rendered glyphs are a credential even after
  the tree redacted its value, and there is no reliable way to blank a
  sub-rectangle of an already-encoded JPEG — so suppression is whole-window, and a
  partial redaction that missed would be worse than none.

Runs on any platform: the spool is redirected into ``tmp_path`` and the native
encode is monkeypatched, so no framework loads and no window is captured.
