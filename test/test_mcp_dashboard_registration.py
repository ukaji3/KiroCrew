"""Managed-MCP registration for ``kirocrew-dashboard``, and why it is its own server.

The dashboard-control tools are deliberately NOT in ``kirocrew-core``. Core is the
surface every session carries and kiro-cli reads ``tools/list`` once per session,
so a capability the user grants occasionally would otherwise spend context in
every request of every session. Three properties encode that decision and must
not regress:

* **The default agent's spec does not carry the server**, in ``mcpServers`` or as
  an ``@kirocrew-dashboard`` ref in ``tools``. kiro-cli loads a server only when
  something references it, so an unreferenced set costs a default session
  literally zero context — the only shape that does.
* **A refresh never re-grants it.** An existing spec that names the server keeps
  its command current; one that does not is left alone, so the grant cannot come
  back on a gateway restart behind the user's back.
* **The managed spec carries NO ``autoApprove`` key.** An autoApproved MCP tool is
  approved inside kiro-cli and never reaches ``hooks.on_tool_call``, so the deny
  floor and governance ceiling would be bypassed for tools that rewrite the
  user's session layout.

The registry assertions mirror ``test_computer_use_registration.py``: a managed
server has to be named in several places, and a half-registered server is the
failure mode that test was written to prevent.
