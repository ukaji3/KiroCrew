"""Behavioural tests for the publish step of .github/workflows/pr-readiness.yml.

`PR Readiness` is the only required status check on protected branches, so the
commit status this step POSTs is the verdict the repository actually gates on.
The labels beside it are advisory decoration.

Two runs of this workflow can evaluate the SAME revision concurrently: every
`pull_request_target` run gets its own concurrency group keyed on `run_id`
(deliberately, so a superseded run never shows as cancelled), which is correct
for two DIFFERENT revisions and leaves two runs on one revision racing. When
that race is lost on a label call, the step must still publish the verdict --
otherwise a cosmetic 404 decides whether the required check reports anything.

These tests extract the step's shell and execute it for real against a `gh`
stub, so the ordering and the tolerance are verified rather than assumed.
Mirrors the harness in test_pr_readiness_sweep.py.

Skipped where the POSIX toolchain the script needs (bash, jq) is unavailable,
which is the case on the Windows leg of the matrix.
