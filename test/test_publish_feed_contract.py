"""Contract tests for the desktop update feeds (electron-updater metadata).

The mac and Linux publish lanes write electron-updater channel files
(``feed/<channel>/latest-mac.yml`` / ``latest-linux.yml``) that
``website/electron/auto-update.js`` consumes via the generic provider. Four
properties are load-bearing and easy to break with a plausible-looking edit,
and none of them fails at PR time -- they strand installed clients in the
field days later:

* **sha512 is BASE64, never hex.** electron-updater string-compares the
  feed's sha512 against a base64 digest of the downloaded bytes
  (``DownloadedUpdateHelper.hashFile``). Swapping ``openssl -binary |
  base64`` for ``sha512sum`` (hex) keeps the feed parsing fine while every
  download fails checksum verification.
* **files[].url is ABSOLUTE and points at the byte host.** The yml lives on
  the POINTER host (updates.crew.kiro.dev/feed/<channel>/); the artifact
  bytes live on the BYTE host (download.crew.kiro.dev/desktop/...).
  electron-updater's ``newUrlFromBase`` does ``new URL(fileUrl, base)``,
  which ignores the base for absolute urls -- that behaviour is what makes
  the pointer/bytes host split work. A bare filename would resolve against
  ``feed/<channel>/`` and 404.
* **Go-live order: bytes -> feed -> latest alias.** A feed written before
  its bytes hands clients a 403/404 mid-update; a latest alias written
  before the feed points ahead of the go-live switch. Asserted on PARSED
  step indices (never substring presence) so the assertion cannot go
  vacuous when steps are renamed or reordered.
* **Missing artifacts fail loudly.** A silent skip would leave a green run
  serving a stale feed -- the operator believes the channel moved while
  every client still sees the old version.

Cache discipline rides along: immutable versioned keys (max-age=31536000 +
conditional write), short-TTL mutable aliases (max-age=300), no-cache feeds.
And every publishing job declares ``environment: prod`` because the publish
role's OIDC trust accepts exactly ref:refs/heads/main and environment:prod.
