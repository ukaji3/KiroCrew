"""The third-party execution denial must be machine-identifiable.

The frontend renders an actionable affordance ("open Security settings") for
exactly one failure: the execution gate refusing to run non-builtin app code.
It has to key that off a stable ``code``, because the accompanying ``error``
prose is English, unlocalizable, and free to be reworded at any time -- string
matching it would break silently on a copy edit.

Two denial sites reach the dashboard and BOTH are pinned here, because they
fail through different shapes: the registry install returns a payload dict, and
``enable_app`` returns an ``AppResult`` whose ``to_dict`` is what the HTTP layer
serializes. That second one is the regression this file exists for --
``AppResult.error_code`` was set by callers but never serialized, so every
structured code was silently dropped on the way out.
