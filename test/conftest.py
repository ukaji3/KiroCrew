    Two separate quantities.

    **Host capacity** -- how many slots exist to compete for:

    1. **Cores.** ``os.cpu_count()``.
    2. **RAM.** ~2 GiB per worker. Cores alone are the wrong unit: a 10-core /
       32 GiB laptop cannot back 32 multi-GiB workers, and once it starts
       swapping the run stops making progress altogether.

    **Per-run cap** (``KIROCREW_MAX_TEST_WORKERS``, default 32) -- the most any
    single run may take. The optimal worker count for this suite plateaus around
    24-32 and then *regresses*: every extra worker re-imports the full app
    (aiohttp/boto3/numpy/pdfplumber/transcribe) and writes its own
    ``.coverage.*`` file to combine at the end. Measured on a 64-core host:
    156s @ 64 workers vs 92s @ 32 workers (-41%).

    Keeping them separate is what makes a big host behave: with 64 cores and a
    cap of 32, two runs get 32 workers each rather than the second collapsing
    while half the machine idles.

    Sharing is what stops the failure this hook was extended for. Two worktrees
    each running ``-n auto`` on a 10-core box previously took 10 workers *each*,
    and the resulting swap thrash produced a load average of ~590 with zero
    tests completing in 21 minutes. Now each run holds a lock per worker it
    intends to spawn (under ``~/.cache/kirocrew/test-slots/<hostname>``, root
    overridable with ``KIROCREW_TEST_SLOT_DIR``): a run alone takes the whole
    machine, and a later run takes only what is unlocked. The locks are held for
    the process's lifetime and released by the kernel when it exits, so an
    orphaned or terminated run frees its share with no cleanup logic at all.

    The cost is fairness, not safety, and only when the host is GENUINELY full:
    a late run arriving at a fully-locked machine drops to its floor of one
    worker -- slow, but never stalled, and never oversubscribing the host the
    way the incident did. While free capacity remains, a later run gets its full
    share.

    """Make the update check's network seam unreachable for the whole suite.

    ``handlers.updates._do_update_check`` now has a second branch: any install
    that is NOT a git checkout is compared against the release-channel feed on the
    CDN. Two ordinary things reach it without a test asking to — ``/api/status``
    fires ``_do_update_check`` as a background task once
    ``_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL`` has elapsed (and ``_last_update_check`` starts at
    ``0.0``, so the first call always qualifies), and any direct call in a test
    env with no ``KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR`` takes the feed branch by definition.

    Without this fixture the suite would make real HTTPS requests to
    ``updates.crew.kiro.dev`` — slow, flaky, offline-hostile, and CI traffic
    nobody asked for. Tests that WANT a feed response stub this same seam, which
    overrides the fixture for that test.

    The refusal is an ``AssertionError`` because that is the loudest signal
    available, but note ``_do_update_check``'s outer ``except Exception`` net will
    convert it into ``error="unknown"`` rather than failing the test — so this is
    a NETWORK guard first and a diagnostic second. A test that means to exercise
    the feed branch must stub the seam and assert on the result.
