"""The channel notice for a removed inbound session-resume binding.

``SessionMap`` audits every removal itself but cannot reach the conversation —
that needs a transport, which the gateway owns. These pin the other half: the
listener ``DashboardState`` registers, which reason it stays quiet for, and the
delivery it performs through the governed cross-surface ladder.

All against fakes — no real transport, session manager, or network.
