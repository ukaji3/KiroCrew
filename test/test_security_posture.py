"""Tests for the security-posture detail registry (``security_posture``).

The registry exists because Settings → Security used to render hardcoded counts
that had silently gone stale by 2-3x. These tests pin the two properties that
make that regression structurally impossible:

1. **Derivation** — every ``count`` is ``len(items)``, and the items come from the
   LIVE control (``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``, ``BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES``,
   ``SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS``, the validation schemas). A control that grows
   without its posture entry growing fails here.
2. **Disclosure** — the payload carries public control definitions and derived
   counts only: no credential material, no governance rule contents, no user data.
