"""Ratchet: every writer of the ``mcp_gateway`` config section must freeze first.

``_resolve_stub_servers`` is deliberately conditional on ``enabled`` (a legacy
config with ``enabled: false`` must resolve to an EMPTY stub set so an upgrade
never invents a daemon). That makes the resolved value UNSTABLE across a change
to ``enabled``, so a writer that leaves the file still riding the deprecated
``poolable_servers`` alias hands the next read a different stub set than the
operator was looking at.

``_freeze_stub_servers`` closes that, but only for the writers that call it.
These tests fail when a NEW writer appears without the freeze, which is the
failure mode a reviewer flagged as invisible: correctness resting on two call
sites with no guard against a third.
