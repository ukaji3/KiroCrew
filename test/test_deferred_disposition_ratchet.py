"""A concern that needs a maintainer ruling must not be dispositioned as deferred work.

``accepted-and-deferred`` and ``needs-a-decision`` look interchangeable in a review
reply and are not. The first says the work is settled and merely out of scope, so a
filed issue names something a contributor can pick up. The second says nobody knows
yet what the right change is, so an issue filed for it carries a question instead of
a task: it cannot be actioned by anyone but the maintainer, it is not read as a
question because it is shaped like a backlog item, and it accumulates one review
round at a time.

Collapsing the two is invisible in every other check. The prose still reads as
diligence, the PR still goes green, and the cost lands weeks later in a tracker full
of items whose bodies ask which of three designs to take.

So this file pins the distinction wherever an agent reads it: any line that
dispositions a concern as ``accepted-and-deferred`` must also offer
``needs-a-decision``, and the prepare-pr skill must keep telling the agent not to
file an issue for one. It is a ratchet, not a description -- it does not care how the
guidance is worded, only that both halves are still there.
