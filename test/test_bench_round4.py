"""Round-4 review findings: derived paths, and a hole created by round 2's own fix.

Both blockings this round came from earlier fixes in this PR, which is the useful
signal: round 3 audited which *entry points* get guarded and that held (no new
ungated entry point was found), but it did not consider paths DERIVED from an
already-guarded one, nor the check-to-use window between guarding a name and opening
it. And the measurability filter added in round 2 introduced a new way for the
comparison to be wrong -- a new field with a default is a new default to be wrong
about.
