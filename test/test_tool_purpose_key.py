"""The reserved tool-purpose argument is read by SHAPE, not by an allowlist.

kiro-cli injects a ``__tool_use_purpose`` property into every tool schema it
exposes, so each tool call carries the agent's own one-line reason for the call
— which the dashboard paints as the concise tool pill label. Nothing validates
that key, though: it is a synthetic parameter the model fills in from prose, and
models paraphrase the name. Real transcripts carry ``__purpose``,
``__thinking_purpose`` and ``__woohoo_purpose``.

Matching a fixed pair of literals dropped every paraphrase, which showed up as
the pill silently falling back to the raw command line (and the stray key
leaking into the arguments view as if it were a real parameter). These tests
lock the shape match in, and lock OUT the two ways it could over-reach: a
tool's own non-reserved ``purpose`` argument, and a name that merely contains
the word.
