"""SessionMap's deferred snapshot flush: off-loop writes that lose nothing.

Issue #2405. On the event loop a mutation marks the map dirty and a debounced
flush task hands an ALREADY SERIALIZED snapshot to a worker thread; ``_data``
never crosses the thread boundary and ``_MAP_LOCK`` is never held across the
await (ratcheted in ``test_session_map_locking.py``). Off the loop, writes stay
inline. Pinned here:

1. a burst of loop-side mutations pays ZERO inline writes and coalesces to one
   file write (this is the fails-before test: pre-deferral, every mutation
   called ``os.replace`` synchronously on the loop);
2. a mutation landing while a flush is in flight is still on disk after the
   map settles — coalescing never drops the trailing write;
3. the payload handed to the worker thread is an immutable snapshot, not
   ``_data``;
4. sync contexts (no running loop) keep writing immediately;
5. ``get()``'s stale-entry prune returns ``None`` immediately and reaches disk
   after the flush, not inline;
6. ``flush()`` is deterministic, and a stale in-flight payload can never land
   over a newer forced write.
