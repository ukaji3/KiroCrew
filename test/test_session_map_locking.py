"""SessionMap's threading contract: the lock, the batch, and the ratchets.

Issue #2989. Every mutation rewrites the WHOLE map from ``_data``, so a
read-modify-write is atomic only while nothing else touches the structure.
Before ``_MAP_LOCK`` the event loop was the only thing providing that, which is
why offloading a single write made the map racy instead of non-blocking (a
``to_thread`` wrapper reverted on #2976 for exactly that reason).

Four properties are pinned here:

1. more than one thread may call the map, and no entry is lost;
2. a ``batched_save`` block is ONE critical section, not merely one write;
3. a lock-FREE reader never observes a half-built structure, which is the price
   of leaving the hot single-key probes unlocked;
4. the two rules that no runtime assertion can express are ratcheted
   structurally — every mutating/iterating method holds the lock, and no
   ``batched_save`` block anywhere in the tree awaits.
