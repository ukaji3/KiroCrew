"""Tests for the prewarm hot-key store's persistence path.

Focused on the platform seam: ``flush()`` writes identity-bearing keys, so it
applies owner-only protection before any content lands. POSIX mode bits and the
Windows DACL are different carriers, and the POSIX one is reached through a name
that does not exist on Windows -- which is what these pin.
