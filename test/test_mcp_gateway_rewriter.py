"""Per-agent rewriter wrapping guards.

A poolable stdio server that the user has explicitly disabled must never be
wrapped into a live pooling stub -- ``_build_stub_entry`` returns a fixed shape
and would drop the ``disabled`` flag, silently re-enabling the muted server in
the agent overlay. These tests pin that guard (mirroring the settings-inject
guard in ``_injectable_settings_servers``).
