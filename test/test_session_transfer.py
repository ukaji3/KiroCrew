"""Session transfer between instances — bundle, validation, and import.

Covers the two halves of the feature (``build_transfer_bundle`` on the sending
side, ``api_chat_slot_import`` on the receiving side) plus the tunnel-manager
delivery hop, with the emphasis on the invariants a reviewer would want pinned:

* **copy, never move** — the source is untouched and the target key is new;
* **project does NOT travel** — the documented decision that an imported
  session arrives unscoped so the user re-picks a checkout;
* **unknown bundle versions are refused** rather than best-effort parsed;
* **the token never appears in a transfer response** (instances.md §6's
  "connect + refresh-token are the only two token-crossing routes").
